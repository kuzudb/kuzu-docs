# Transforming your data to graphs - Part 2

In the [previous post](/blog/transforming-your-data-to-graphs-1), we showed how to transform a
typical relational data model to a graph data model and load it into a Kùzu database that could
then be queried via Cypher to answer path-related questions about the data. The aim of this post is
to show how Kùzu offers numerous tools that allow users to
flexibly model and analyze data. We will analyze a transaction network, and
use a combination of Cypher queries, graph visualization and network analysis to answer questions
about the data.

The code to reproduce the workflow shown in this post can be found in the
[graphdb-demo](https://github.com/kuzudb/graphdb-demo/tree/main/src/python/transactions_with_disputes) repository.
It uses Kùzu's Python API, but you are welcome to use the client API [of your choice](https://kuzudb.com/docusaurus/client-apis).

## Analyzing a transaction network

The dataset used in this post extends from the one used in the previous post and is an example of a network
of clients, merchants and their transactions. It's inspired by a similar dataset used in the book
*Graph Powered Machine Learning*[^1].

In the real world, especially when credit card transactions are involved, it's all
too common to see cases of fraud. Certain transactions can be disputed
by clients who have cause to believe that a transaction was unauthorized or fraudulent. In such cases,
the client marks a transaction as disputed.

### Relational schema

Imagine that you are an analyst tasked with investigating such a dataset. The most likely source of
such a dataset would be a relational system, with a schema that looks something like this:

<div class="img-center">
<img src={RelationalSchema}/>
</div>

The primary table of interest is the `transactions` table, which contains records of all the
transactions made by a client with a particular merchant. A merchant is a store or a business that
provides goods or services. The `disputes` table contains records of all the disputed transactions,
marked after the fact and stored in a separate table.

When considering questions about disputed transactions, aggregation queries are not enough. We need
to study the paths between the clients, merchants and transactions. This is where a graph
database like Kùzu is very handy. The data model used by Kùzu is a _structured_ property graph model,
allowing us to capture the relationships between entities in a more natural way, for specific query
workloads such as this one.

### Graph schema

The following graph schema makes sense for our dataset:

<div class="img-center">
<img src={GraphSchema}/>
</div>

The transactions are modelled as edges, with an `is_disputed` property to indicate whether
a transaction is disputed or not. This simplifies the kinds of queries we need to write, and is
sufficient for our initial analysis.

## Inserting data into Kùzu

The [previous post](/blog/transforming-your-data-to-graphs-1) went into the data transformation
and ETL aspects, so we won't go over that here. In a nutshell, the following input files exist in CSV
format that need to be inserted into Kùzu:

```
.
├── data
│   ├── node
│   │   ├── client.csv
│   │   ├── city.csv
│   │   ├── company.csv
│   │   ├── merchant.csv
│   │   └── disputed_transactions.csv
│   └── rel
│       ├── belongs_to.csv
│       ├── located_in.csv
│       └── transacted_with.csv
└── load_data.py
```

The script `load_data.py` reads the CSV files and inserts the data into Kùzu using the Python API.
The result of running this script is a graph whose schema matches that shown in the sketch
above.

<div class="img-center">
<img src={KuzuExplorerSchema}/>
</div>

## Exploratory data analysis

Once the data is loaded into Kùzu, it's very simple to begin exploring the data using Cypher queries
in one of three ways: i) using a Kùzu CLI shell, ii) using a Jupyter notebook, and iii) using the
Kùzu Explorer UI. Because the goal of this exercise is to perform exploratory data analysis on the
graph, we'll [Kùzu Explorer](https://github.com/kuzudb/explorer) to visualize the graph and run Cypher queries.

```sql
MATCH (c:Client) RETURN COUNT(c) AS numClients
```

numClients |
--- |
100 |


```sql
MATCH (m:Merchant) RETURN COUNT(m) AS numMerchants
```


numMerchants |
--- |
100 |

```sql
MATCH (:Client)-[t:TransactedWith]->(:Merchant)
RETURN COUNT(t) AS numTransactions
```

numTransactions |
--- |
1100 |

The dataset contains 1,000 clients who made 1,100 transactions with 100 merchants. We can visualize
the transactions with a particular merchant at a particular city and belonging to a particular
company using the following query:

```sql
MATCH (c:Client)-[t:TransactedWith]->(m:Merchant)-[b:BelongsTo]->(co:Company)
MATCH (m)-[l:LocatedIn]->(ci:City {city: "Boston"})
WHERE co.company = "Panera Bread"
RETURN * LIMIT 25;
```

The dataset contains two merchants belonging to Panera Bread in the city of Boston.

<div class="img-center">
<img src={QueryBostonPanera}/>
</div>

## Study disputed transactions

The dataset becomes more interesting when we begin studying disputed
transactions. Not all disputed transactions are fraudulent, and so a simple aggregation query won't
reveal many insights. We can begin by isolating only the vicinity of the disputed transactions of the 
graph by specifying the boolean relationship property
`is_disputed` and then adding a subsequent `MATCH` statement to find the other merchants with whom
clients reported disputed transactions.

```sql
MATCH (c:Client)-[t:TransactedWith]->(m:Merchant)
MATCH (c)-[t2:TransactedWith]->(m2:Merchant)
WHERE t.is_disputed = true
RETURN * LIMIT 25;
```

When running this query in Kùzu Explorer, we can customize the edge properties displayed in the graph visualization. In
the following image, we mark the `TransactedWith` edges with the boolean value of the `is_disputed`
property from the data. Only a small fraction of these transactions have the `is_disputed` property
marked as `true`.

<div class="img-center">
<img src={QueryDisputedVicinity}/>
</div>

It can be seen that certain clients interacted with multiple merchants, some of which form a cluster.
In other cases, nodes in the vicinity of a disputed transaction have no common paths with the larger graph,
resulting in a disjoint subgraph. Fraud is less likely in the latter case, because a fraudster would
likely have interacted with multiple clients that are part of a cluster sharing common merchants.

The list of client names who reported disputed transactions can be listed as follows:

```sql
MATCH (c:Client)-[t:TransactedWith]->(m:Merchant)
WHERE t.is_disputed = true
RETURN c.name AS name, t.timestamp AS transactionTime;
```

name | transactionTime |
--- | --- |
Joshua T. | `2023-11-21T16:54:30Z`
Jennifer Y. | `2023-12-24T17:39:33Z`
Brandon T. | `2023-08-04T18:21:27Z`
Cynthia J. | `2023-12-24T02:49:31Z`
Olivia C. | `2023-12-27T04:23:04Z`


Depending on the dataset, the time stamps of the disputed transactions in comparison to the timestamp
of the transaction itself, could yield additional insights. The power of a graph structure is that
it allows us to isolate substructures of interest based on the connected nature of the data. 

The aim of the next query is to find the city in which the most
disputed transactions occurred, and also to which companies the merchants processing these transactions
belonged to.

```sql
MATCH (c:Client)-[t:TransactedWith]->(:Merchant)
WHERE t.is_disputed = true
WITH c
MATCH (c)-[t2:TransactedWith*..2]->(m:Merchant)-[:BelongsTo]->(co:Company)
WITH c, m, co
MATCH (m)-[:LocatedIn]->(ci:City)
RETURN
    m.merchant_id AS merchantID,
    ci.city AS city,
    co.company AS company,
    COLLECT(c.name) AS clients,
    COUNT(c) AS counts
ORDER BY counts DESC LIMIT 3;
```

merchantID | city | company | clients | counts
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
70 | Boston | Walmart | `["Olivia C.","Jennifer Y.","Cynthia J."]` | 3
76 | San Francisco | Panera Bread | `["Joshua T.","Cynthia J."]` | 2
51 | Chicago | AT&T | `["Cynthia J.","Cynthia J."]` | 2

It can be seen that the clients Olivia, Cynthia and Jennifer all reported disputed transactions
in a particular merchant location in Boston that belongs to the company Walmart. The query above
returned the names of the clients, but in a larger dataset it makes sense to return the
number of clients instead.

When viewed visually, these results can be quite powerful. The following image shows result from
above, as seen in Kùzu Explorer.

<div class="img-center">
<img src={DisputeGraphViz}/>
</div>

If we simply look at aggregates based on the company and merchant, we see that the clients Olivia,
Jennifer and Cynthia from the previous query each reported disputed transactions in _different_
merchant locations. However, they all had a common merchant in Boston (ID 70) belonging to Walmart, that
they all made transactions within a plausible time window. This could indicate that this particular
merchant, located in Boston, could be a source of fraud.

## Graph algorithms

Kùzu is well-integrated with the PyData ecosystem, including PyTorch Geometric, Pandas, and
[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/index.html), a popular Python library
for network analysis. Because Kùzu is an embedded graph database, it runs in-process with a Python
application, so it's simple to isolate a subgraph of interest via Cypher and convert it
to a NetworkX directed graph (DiGraph) for further analysis.

### Weakly connected components

A weakly connected component is a maximal subgraph in which there is a path between any two nodes,
ignoring the direction of the edges. In the context of our subgraph of clients, merchants and the
vicinity of disputed transactions, we can use this algorithm to isolate the disjoint subgraphs that
we saw in the visualization earlier.

We first isolate the subgraph of clients, merchants and transactions in the vicinity of disputed
transactions as follows:

```py
import kuzu
import networkx as nx

db = kuzu.Database("./transaction_db")
conn = kuzu.Connection(db)

# Isolate the subgraph of interest
disputed_vicinity = conn.execute(
    """
    MATCH (c1:Client)-[t1:TransactedWith]->(m:Merchant)<-[t2:TransactedWith]-(c2:Client)
    WHERE t1.is_disputed = true
    RETURN *;
    """
)

# Convert to networkx DiGraph
G1 = clients.get_as_networkx(directed=True)
```

For every client that reported a disputed transaction, we isolate the subgraph of all the clients
who interacted with these same merchants, as well as others. Running the weakly connected components
algorithm will first inform us whether the vicinity of disputed transactions is a single connected
component or not.

```py
num_weakly_connected_components = nx.number_weakly_connected_components(G1)
print(num_weakly_connected_components)

# Output
2
```

We obtain 2 weakly connected components, indicating that there are disjoint components in the
disputed transactions subgraph.

To see which clients/merchants are in each weakly connected component, we can run the following:

```py
weakly_connected_components = list(nx.weakly_connected_components(G2))

print(len(weakly_connected_components[0]))
print(len(weakly_connected_components[1]))

# Output
52
9
```

The first cluster of clients and merchants contains 52 nodes, while the second cluster contains 9
nodes. This helps narrow down on a transaction subgraph that has a greater degree of connectivity.

### Closeness centrality

Centrality algorithms are among the most commonly used algorithms in graph data science. 
At a high-level, centrality algorithms are used to identify "important" nodes - specifically, nodes
that serve the role of connecting many other nodes in the graph. Suppose the owner of our
transaction graph is an e-commerce company, and that the company wants to promote its
"important merchants" to attract more customers to its network. Centrality metrics, similar to the
popular PageRank metric, are concrete ways to order nodes in terms of "importance".

Closeness centrality[^2] measures how close a node `n` is to all other nodes by calculating the
*average* of the shortest path length from `n` to every other node in the graph. For this example,
we will first isolate the full subgraph of all clients, merchants and transactions, not
just those in the vicinity of disputed transactions.

```py
subgraph = conn.execute(
    """
    MATCH (c:Client)-[t:TransactedWith]->(m:Merchant)
    RETURN *;
    """
)

# Convert to networkx DiGraph
G2 = subgraph.get_as_networkx(directed=True)

closeness_centrality_result = list(nx.closeness_centrality(G1).items())
closeness_centrality_result.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
print(closeness_centrality_result[:5])
```

The top 5 nodes with the highest closeness centrality are shown below:

```
[('Merchant_35', 0.028),
 ('Merchant_56', 0.02666666666666667),
 ('Merchant_38', 0.025333333333333333),
 ('Merchant_66', 0.025333333333333333),
 ('Merchant_96', 0.024)]
```

The scores indicate that the merchant with ID 35 is the most central node in the subgraph, i.e.,
it's on average the closest to other nodes in the graph as a lot of paths go through it. Pandas
makes this process very convenient.

```py
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(closeness_centrality_result, columns=["node_id", "closeness_centrality"])
df = df[df["node_id"].str.startswith("Merchant_")]
df["node_id"] = df["node_id"].str.replace("Merchant_", "").astype(int)
df = df.sort_values(by="closeness_centrality", ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)
print(df.head(5))
```

node_id | closeness_centrality
--- | ---
35 | 0.028000
56 | 0.026667
38 | 0.025333
66 | 0.025333
96 | 0.024000

Once we have the Pandas DataFrame, it's trivial to write a function that can modify the existing
`Merchant` node table and add the closeness centrality scores back to the graph. Kùzu's Python
API has a native scan feature that can directly read from Pandas DataFrames in a zero-copy manner.

Note that we first alter the original node table schema to add a new column for the closeness
centrality scores. We then use the `LOAD FROM` command to read the Pandas DataFrame into the graph.
```py
try:
    # Alter original node table schema to add degree centrality
    conn.execute('ALTER TABLE Merchant ADD closeness_centrality DOUBLE DEFAULT 0.0')
except RuntimeError:
    # If the column already exists, do nothing
    pass
# Read degree centrality to graph
conn.execute(
    """
    LOAD FROM df
    MERGE (m:Merchant {merchant_id: node_id})
    ON MATCH SET m.closeness_centrality = closeness_centrality
    RETURN *;
    """
)
```

Applying a similar process to the client nodes (via other centrality algorithms like degree centrality)
can help us use these scores in downstream machine learning models, or to inform further decisions.

## Conclusions

Hopefully, this post has given you a good idea of how to use Kùzu to effectively model and analyze
your data via a combination of Cypher and graph algorithms. It's worth keeping in mind that
Graph data science, just like conventional data science, is an iterative
process. The ability to think of structured data (in tables) as graphs helps us rapidly isolate interesting subsets of the data,
run graph algorithms and visualize substructures, making these powerful tools in the data scientist's toolkit.

Kùzu's in-process architecture makes it very friendly towards these sorts of workflows without the
data scientist having to worry about servers or managing infrastructure. Data can be conveniently read into Kùzu from a
variety of sources, including relational databases, CSV or parquet files, or DataFrames. Future
versions of Kùzu will support more convenience features, such as the ability to natively scan
PostgreSQL tables, as well as native support for Arrow tables.

In summary, the interoperability of an embedded graph database with popular Python libraries like
NetworkX and Pandas makes Kùzu a powerful tool for graph data science. If you have data of a similar
nature in the form of relational tables, we highly recommend you to
think about whether your use case can benefit from graph data models. If so, give Kùzu a try and
