# KùzuExplorer: Visualizing Query Results and Schemas Interactively

## Overview

Today, we are happy to release KùzuExplorer, which is Kùzu's browser-based frontend to
visualize and explore database schemas and query results in the form of a graph and/or tables.
This is a very useful tool for exploring databases and debugging applications during prototyping
phase. This post describes a brief overview of the main features of KùzuExplorer with pointers to 
[KuzuExplorer documentation](./../kuzuexplorer) for details.
