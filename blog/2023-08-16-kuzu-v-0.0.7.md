## Cypher Features

### Merge Clause
This release introduces `MERGE` clause which is an updating clause that will first try to match the given pattern and, if not found, create the pattern. At a high level, `MERGE <pattern>` can be interrepted as `If MATCH <pattern> then RETURN <pattern> ELES CREATE <patten>`. Additionally, user can specify further `SET` operation based on whether the pattern is found or not through `ON CREATE` and `ON MATCH`.

For example, the following query tries to merge a user node with name "Adam". Since the tuple exists in the database, we update its age property and return the tuple.
```
MERGE (n:User {name : 'Adam'}) ON MATCH SET n.age = 35 RETURN n.*;
------------------
| n.name | n.age |
------------------
| Adam   | 35    |
------------------
```
Below is another example where we try to merge a follows edge since 2022 between "Adam" and "Karissa".
```
MATCH (a:User), (b:User) 
WHERE a.name = 'Adam' AND b.name = 'Karissa' 
MERGE (a)-[e:Follows {since:2022}]->(b) 
ON CREATE SET e.since = 1999
RETURN e;
---------------------------------------------------------
| e                                                     |
---------------------------------------------------------
| (0:0)-{_LABEL: Follows, _ID: 0:5, since: 1999}->(0:1) |
---------------------------------------------------------
```

### Create Macro 

## Data Export
Kùzu now supports export query results to CSV files using the `COPY TO` command. This feature enables seamless extraction of query outputs into CSV format. By default, headers are included, and data fields are comma-separated. For instance:

```
COPY (MATCH (p:person) RETURN p.ID, p.name) TO 'person.csv';
```

The resulting CSV file maintains the query's structure:

```
p.ID,p.name
0,"Alice"
2,"Bob"
3,"Carol"
5,"Dan"
9,"Greg"
...
```

Even nested data types like lists and structs are appropriately captured in the exported CSV. This enhancement simplifies data export and facilitates compatibility with external tools and systems. See [Data Export](../data-export/) on our documentation for more information.
