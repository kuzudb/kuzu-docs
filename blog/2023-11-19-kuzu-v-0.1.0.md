# K첫zu 0.1.0 Release

We are very happy to release K첫zu 0.1.0 today! This is a major release with the following features and improvements:

<!--truncate-->

## New Storage Layer

K첫zu has moved to a node-group based storage design.

**TODO(Guodong)**: 
- Fill this section.

### String Compression

Together with new storage design, we introduce dictionary compression algorithm for strings. 

**TODO(Guodong & Ben)**: 
- Fill this section.
- Micro benchmark LDBC100 Comment.
  - Data size.
  - Loading performance.
  - Scan performance.
- (Optional) Discuss the generalization of bit packing to integer, offset, ...

## New Features

### Scan DataFrame
K첫zu now supports scanning over Pandas DataFrame as a regular table through

Consider the following DataFrame,
```
data = {
    'id': np.array([0, 1, 2], dtype=np.int64),
    'age': np.array([20, 32, 42], dtype=np.uint32)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```
The query below finds all person who are older than the average age computed from the given DataFrame.
```
query = "CALL read_pandas('df') 
         WITH AVG(age) AS avg_age 
         MATCH (a:Person) 
         WHERE a.age > avg_age 
         RETURN a;"
results = conn.execute(query)
```

**TODO(Ziyi)**:
- I think we should try to support the following case.

You can also load a DataFrame directly into a node or relationship table.
```
conn.execute("CREATE NODE TABLE pd (id INT64, age UINT32, PRIMARY KEY(id))")
query = "Copy pd FROM read_pandas('df');"
results = conn.execute(query)
```

### Copy

#### Copy To Parquet
Query result can be exported to Parquet format.
```
COPY ( MATCH (a:Person) RETURN a.* ) TO "person.parquet";
```

#### Copy To CSV
We added serveral configurations when exporting to CSV format.
```
COPY ( MATCH (a:Person) RETURN a.* ) TO "person.csv" (delim = '|', header=true);
```

TODO(Ziyi):
- Benchmark copy performance?

#### Copy From Column Reorder
Similar to Postgres, user can now add column names in `COPY FROM`. Column names specify columns to be copied and can be a subset of total columns with arbitrary order.

```
CREATE NODE TABLE Person (id INT64, name STRING, comment STRING, PRIMARY KEY(id));
COPY Person (name, id) FROM "person.csv";
```
The code above first create a Person table with 3 columns and then loads the two columns from file into `name` and `id` respectively. `comment` column will be set to default `NULL` value.


### Updates

#### Detach Delete
TODO(Guodong):
- Implement this
TODO(Xiyang):
- Fill section

#### Return Deleted Row
```
DELETE (a:Person) RETURN a;
```

#### Read Follows Update

TODO(Xiyang):
- Find a reasonable example.

### Others

#### Casting

We have moved to SQL-style casting function `cast(input, target type)`. E,g,

#### INT128

We added 16 bytes huge integer.

#### Recursive Join Node Filter 

```
Match p = (a:User)-[:Follows (r, n | WHERE n.)]->(b:User) RETURN p;
```

## Development

### Nightly Build

### Reduce Binary Size

#### Remove Arrow Dependency

#### Prune Symbols
TODO(Keenan):
- Fill this section briefly.
