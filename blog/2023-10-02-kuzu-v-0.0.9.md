# K첫zu 0.0.9 Release

We are very happy to release K첫zu 0.0.9 today! This release comes with the following new main features and improvements: 

## New Features

### LOAD FROM
K첫zu now supports direct query over a file without loading into database through `LOAD FROM` clause. E.g. the following query counts number of
```
LOAD FROM "test.csv"
WHERE 
RETURN COUNT(*)
```
`LOAD FROM` can also be used as the input source of bulk update.
```
LOAD FROM "test.csv"
CREATE (:Person {})
```

By default, K첫zu will read the header of the file to detect column name and type. If no header is avaliable it will use auto-generated name and parse as string. To manually specify the header, you can use `LOAD FROM <file> WITH HEADER ()`.

### Transaction Statement
This release replaces the `beginReadTransaction()`, `beginWriteTransaction()`, `commit()` and `rollback()` APIs in all language bindings with statements. E.g.
```
BEGIN WRITE TRANSACTION;
CREATE (a:User {name: 'Alice', age: 72});
MATCH (a:User) RETURN *;
COMMIT;
``` 
The above sequence of statements starts a manual write transaction, adds a new node, and within the same transaction also reads all of the tuples in User table. Finally, commits the transaction.

### CREATE REL GROUP

### Recursive Rel Projection

## Performance Improvements

### Parallel CSV Reader
We replace arrow's streaming CSV reader with a parallel CSV reader. Parallel CSV reader assumes no multi-line strings and provide a performance boost linear to the number of threads given.

If multi-line string presents, CSV reader will fail and you need to fall back to single thread mode.

### Bitpacking Compression

### General Data Loading Improvement
Data loading time is improved due the following changes
- parallel csv reader.
- bitpacking compression to write less data to disk.
- remove line counting when copying rel tables.
- dedicated casting functions to avoid string copy.
