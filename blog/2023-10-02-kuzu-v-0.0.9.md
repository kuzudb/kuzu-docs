# K첫zu 0.0.9 Release

We are very happy to release K첫zu 0.0.7 today! This release comes with the following new main features and improvements: 

## New Features

### LOAD FROM
K첫zu now supports direct query over a file without loading into database through `LOAD FROM` clause. E.g. the following query counts number of
```
LOAD FROM "test.csv"
WHERE 
RETURN COUNT(*)
```
`LOAD FROM` can also be used as the input source of bulk update.
```
LOAD FROM "test.csv"
CREATE (:Person {})
```

By default, K첫zu will read the header of the file to detect column name and type. If no header is avaliable it will use auto-generated name and parse as string. To manually specify the header, you can use `LOAD FROM <file> WITH HEADER ()`.
