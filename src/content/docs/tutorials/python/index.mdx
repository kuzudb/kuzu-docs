This tutorial will get you started using Kuzu's Python API to analyze a dataset.

In this tutorial, we will use the following social network dataset that consists of users and their posts.

<LinkCard

  href="/tutorials/example-database"
/>

## Setup

Ensure that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system. For this tutorial, we will use
a virtual environment and install Kuzu via `pip`, but feel free to do your own thing, or refer to this [page](/installation/#python)
for alternative installation methods.
```bash
python -m venv kuzu_social_network
cd kuzu_social_network
source bin/activate
pip install kuzu
```

Next, [download the zipped data](https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/kuzu-test/tutorial/tutorial_data.zip) and unzip the files.
```bash
curl -o tutorial_data.zip https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/kuzu-test/tutorial/tutorial_data.zip
unzip tutorial_data.zip
rm tutorial_data.zip
```

Before we can start querying the data, we need to create a new Kuzu database and import the CSV files.
Since this is a one-time operation, we will use a separate Python script. We will also create another
script to contain the querying logic.

Make a new `src` directory and create the `create_db.py` and `main.py` files in it.
```bash
mkdir src
echo "print('Hello, world!')" > src/create_db.py
cp src/create_db.py src/main.py
```

Your directory should now look something like this:
```
kuzu_social_network
│   ...
├── src
│   ├── create_db.py
│   └── main.py
└── tutorial_data
    ├── node
    │   ├── post.csv
    │   └── user.csv
    └── relation
        ├── FOLLOWS.csv
        ├── LIKES.csv
        └── POSTS.csv
```

Test the setup by running the two Python scripts.
```bash
$ python src/create_db.py
Hello, world!

$ python src/main.py
Hello, world!
```
We are now ready to start the tutorial.

## Create the database
Clear out the contents of `src/create_db.py` and import Kuzu:
```py
import kuzu
```
Next, create and connect to an empty Kuzu database:
```py
def main() -> None:
    db = kuzu.Database("./social_network_db")
    conn = kuzu.Connection(db)

    # Rest of the code goes here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will create a database directory `./social_network_db` where the imported CSV data will be stored.

Kuzu also supports an `in-memory` mode where the database is active only during the execution of the Python program.
For more information, refer to the example in the [create your first graph]() section.

### Define schema
The first step in building a Kuzu graph is to define a schema.
For our example dataset, we need the following node and relationship tables:
```py
conn.execute("""
    CREATE NODE TABLE User (
        user_id INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
        username STRING,
        account_creation_date DATE
    )""")
conn.execute("""
    CREATE NODE TABLE Post (
        post_id INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
        post_date DATE,
        like_count INT64,
        retweet_count INT64
    )""")
conn.execute("""
    CREATE REL TABLE FOLLOWS (
        FROM User TO User
    )""")
conn.execute("""
    CREATE REL TABLE POSTS (
        FROM User TO Post
    )""")
conn.execute("""
    CREATE REL TABLE LIKES (
        FROM User TO Post
    )""")
```

### Import CSV data
We can now import the CSV data into the node and relationship tables:
```py
conn.execute("COPY User FROM './tutorial_data/node/user.csv'")
conn.execute("COPY Post FROM './tutorial_data/node/post.csv'")
conn.execute("COPY FOLLOWS FROM './tutorial_data/relation/FOLLOWS.csv'")
conn.execute("COPY POSTS FROM './tutorial_data/relation/POSTS.csv'")
conn.execute("COPY LIKES FROM './tutorial_data/relation/LIKES.csv'")
```
See the documentation on [importing data](/import/csv) for more details on the parameters for CSV import.

### Show table information
Finally, we can print out a list of tables:
```py
result = conn.execute("CALL SHOW_TABLES() RETURN *")

print(result.get_column_names())
while result.has_next():
    print(result.get_next())
```

### Running the code
Run `create_db.py` to create the Kuzu database and import the CSV files:
```bash
$ python src/create_db.py
['id', 'name', 'type', 'database name', 'comment']
[0, 'User', 'NODE', 'local(kuzu)', '']
[1, 'Post', 'NODE', 'local(kuzu)', '']
[2, 'FOLLOWS', 'REL', 'local(kuzu)', '']
[3, 'POSTS', 'REL', 'local(kuzu)', '']
[4, 'LIKES', 'REL', 'local(kuzu)', '']
```

:::note[Note]
If you run the program again, you'll get an error about duplicated primary keys.
This is because the data has already been imported into the Kuzu database. You
will have to delete the database directory (i.e. `rm -rf ./social_network_db`)
in between runs.
:::

## Query the graph
We can now start querying the graph to answer some questions about the social network.

Replace the contents of `src/main.py` with the following code snippet:
```py
import kuzu

def main() -> None:
    db = kuzu.Database("./social_network_db")
    conn = kuzu.Connection(db)

    # Query to be filled out below
    result = conn.execute(...)

    print(result.get_column_names())
    while result.has_next():
        print(result.get_next())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, for each of the following queries, replace `...` with the query and run the program as:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Q1: Which user has the most followers? And how many followers do they have?
First, we use a simple `MATCH` query to list some users who are followed by some other user:
```cypher
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
RETURN u2.username
LIMIT 5
```
```
['u2.username']
['coolwolf752']
['stormfox762']
['stormninja678']
['darkdog878']
['brightninja683']
```

For each relation `FOLLOWS`, this will simply return the followee's username of that relation.
Next, we will improve on this query by using aggregation.

Let's count the number of appearances of a followee by using the `COUNT()` function:
```cypher
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
RETURN u2.username, COUNT(u2) AS follower_count
LIMIT 5
```
```
['u2.username', 'follower_count']
['darkdog878', 6]
['epicking81', 3]
['fastgirl798', 4]
['stormcat597', 2]
['epiccat105', 4]
```

This is a lot more useful! We can now clearly see how many followers each user has.

Lastly, we use `ORDER_BY` and `LIMIT` to order the usernames by their followers count, and return
only the first entry. This is one of the users we are looking for, including the count of how many followers
that user has:
```cypher
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
RETURN u2.username, COUNT(u2) AS follower_count
ORDER BY follower_count DESC
LIMIT 1
```
```
['u2.username', 'follower_count']
['stormninja678', 6]
```

This dataset has multiple users with the greatest follower count of `6`. So, we are
excluding other users with the same follower count as `stormninja678` (or whoever appeared first).
If you want to retrieve all of them, the query becomes a bit longer:
```cypher
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
WITH u2, COUNT(u1) as follower_count
WITH MAX(follower_count) as max_count
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
WITH u2, COUNT(u1) as follower_count, max_count
WHERE follower_count = max_count
RETURN u2.username, follower_count
```

### Q2: What is the shortest path between two users?
We might also be interested in finding the shortest path between two users. For example, how
many follows does it take to get from user `silentguy245` to `epicwolf202`?

We can query this by using a [recursive match](/cypher/query-clauses/match) to find the shortest path length:
```cypher
MATCH p = (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS* SHORTEST]->(u2:User)
WHERE u1.username = 'silentguy245'
AND u2.username = 'epicwolf202'
RETURN p
```
```
['p']
[{'_nodes': [{'_id': {'offset': 19, 'table': 0}, '_label': 'User', 'user_id': 20, 'username': 'silentguy245', 'account_creation_date': datetime.date(2022, 10, 11)}, {'_id': {'offset': 14, 'table': 0}, '_label': 'User', 'user_id': 15, 'username': 'mysticwolf198', 'account_creation_date': datetime.date(2021, 1, 4)}, {'_id': {'offset': 0, 'table': 0}, '_label': 'User', 'user_id': 1, 'username': 'epicwolf202', 'account_creation_date': datetime.date(2022, 9, 9)}], '_rels': [{'_src': {'offset': 19, 'table': 0}, '_dst': {'offset': 14, 'table': 0}, '_label': 'FOLLOWS', '_id': {'offset': 64, 'table': 2}}, {'_src': {'offset': 14, 'table': 0}, '_dst': {'offset': 0, 'table': 0}, '_label': 'FOLLOWS', '_id': {'offset': 47, 'table': 2}}]}]
```
This will return a result of the `RECURSIVE_REL` datatype, which as you can see is difficult to interpret.

To make this more useful, we will collect just the usernames in the path by using a [recursive relationship function](/cypher/expressions/recursive-rel-functions).
```cypher
MATCH p = (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS* SHORTEST]->(u2:User)
WHERE u1.username = 'silentguy245'
AND u2.username = 'epicwolf202'
RETURN PROPERTIES(NODES(p), 'username')
```
```
['PROPERTIES(NODES(p),username)']
[['silentguy245', 'mysticwolf198', 'epicwolf202']]
```
This is much easier to read! We can now clearly see the shortest path between the two users with one user, `mysticwolf198`, in between them.

### Q3: How many 3-hop paths exist between userA and userB that passes through userC?
To answer this query, we will follow a similar approach as Q1. We first count the number of 3-hop queries:
```cypher
MATCH (u1:User)-[f1:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)-[f2:FOLLOWS]->(u3:User)-[f3:FOLLOWS]->(u4:User)
RETURN COUNT(u4)
```
```
['COUNT(u4._ID)']
[667]
```
This tells us that there are 667 paths of length 3 in the graph.
Next, we use a prepared statement to construct queries involving particular users.

#### Run a prepared statement
We will now modify the query to only match paths with userA, userB, and userC.
Here, we will use [prepared statements]() to separate the query from its *parameters*.
We arbitrarily choose userA to be `epicwolf202`, userB to be `stormcat597`, and userC to be `stormfox762`.
```py
query = """
    MATCH (u1:User)-[f1:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)-[f2:FOLLOWS]->(u3:User)-[f3:FOLLOWS]->(u4:User)
    WHERE u1.username = $usersrc
    AND u4.username = $userdst
    AND (u2.username = $userint OR u3.username = $userint)
    RETURN COUNT(u4)
    """
prepared_stmt = conn.prepare(query)
usersrc = "epicwolf202"
userdst = "stormcat597"
userint = "stormfox762"
params = {
    'usersrc': usersrc,
    'userdst': userdst,
    'userint': userint
}
result = conn.execute(prepared_stmt, params)
```
```
['COUNT(u4._ID)']
[1]
```
This tells us that there is exactly one path of length 3 between the three users specified.
