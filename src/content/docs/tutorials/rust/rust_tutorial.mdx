This tutorial will get you started using Kuzu's Rust API to analyze a dataset.

See the link below for the example dataset used in this tutorial.

<LinkCard
  title="Example dataset"
  description="Social network dataset used in this tutorial"
  href="/tutorials/example-database"
/>

The dataset is a social network dataset of users and posts. Download the dataset and unzip it
in your current working directory.

## Setup

First ensure that you have Rust installed on your system. Install the Rust API of Kuzu
via the following steps:

```bash
# Initialize a new Rust project
cargo new social_network_rs
cd social_network_rs
# Install the Rust API of Kuzu into the project
cargo add kuzu
```

Create a new directory at the root level of the project called `social_network_rs`. Next, [download the zipped data](https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/kuzu-test/tutorial/tutorial_data.zip),
unzip the files and copy them to the `tutorial_data` directory at the root level of the project.

Then, run the following command to initialize a Rust project at the root level of the project:
```bash
cd social_network_rs
cargo init
```

Your directory will look something like this:
```
tutorial_data/
├── node/
│   ├── user.csv
│   └── post.csv
└── relation/
│   ├── FOLLOWS.csv
│   ├── POSTS.csv
│   └── LIKES.csv
social_network_rs/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── Cargo.lock
└── bin
    └── query.rs
```

Replace `main.rs` with the following code snippet:
```rs
use kuzu::{Connection, Database, Error, SystemConfig};

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    // This is where our queries will be inputted and executed.

}
```

We are now ready to start the tutorial.

## Create an instance of the database
In order to create the graph in Kuzu, we first need to create a new Kuzu database. We do this by using the following commands in Rust:
```rs
// Create an empty on-disk database and connect to it
let db = Database::new("./social_network_rs_db", SystemConfig::default())?;
let conn = Connection::new(&db)?;
```
This will create a database directory called `./social_network_rs_db`, where our data will be stored.
Kuzu also supports `in-memory mode` in which case the lifetime of the database will be only during the execution of the Rust program.
For more information, refer to the example in the [create your first graph](/get-started/#index) section.

## Define schema
The first step in building any Kuzu graph is schema definition. We will define the node and relationships tables
as per our desired schema as follows:
```rs
conn.query("
CREATE NODE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS User(
    user_id INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
    username STRING,
    account_creation_date DATE
)
")?;
conn.query("
    CREATE NODE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Post(
        post_id INT64 PRIMARY KEY, 
        post_date DATE, 
        like_count INT64, 
        retweet_count INT64
    )")?;
conn.query("
    CREATE REL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS FOLLOWS(
        FROM User TO User
    )")?;
conn.query("
    CREATE REL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS POSTS(
        FROM User TO Post
    )")?;
conn.query("
    CREATE REL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS LIKES(
        FROM User TO Post
    )")?;
```

## Show table information

We can check information on the tables we have in the database with the following commands:
```rs
let mut result = conn.query("CALL SHOW_TABLES() RETURN *")?;
println!("{}", result.display());
```
Returns:
```
id|name|type|database name|comment
0|User|NODE|local(kuzu)|
1|Post|NODE|local(kuzu)|
2|FOLLOWS|REL|local(kuzu)|
3|POSTS|REL|local(kuzu)|
4|LIKES|REL|local(kuzu)|
```

## Copy data

After creating the tables, we can copy them into the node and relationship tables. We do so by using the
`COPY FROM` commands.

```rs
conn.query("COPY User FROM '../tutorial_data/node/user.csv'")?;
conn.query("COPY Post FROM '../tutorial_data/node/post.csv'")?;
conn.query("COPY FOLLOWS FROM '../tutorial_data/relation/FOLLOWS.csv'")?;
conn.query("COPY POSTS FROM '../tutorial_data/relation/POSTS.csv'")?;
conn.query("COPY LIKES FROM '../tutorial_data/relation/LIKES.csv'")?;
```
See the documentation on [importing data](/import/csv) for more details on the parameters for CSV import.

To run the above code, we simply run the following command:
```bash
cargo run --bin social_network_rs
```
The data is now copied into the database.

## Query the graph

We can now proceed to querying the graph to answer some questions about the social network. Below are
some examples.

To keep the query logic separated from the copy logic, we will create a new file called `./bin/query.rs` and
move the queries to this file.

To run the `query.rs` file, we can run the following command:
```bash
cargo run --bin query
```

:::note[Note]
The `query.rs` file is a separate executable that is built when running `cargo run --bin query`.
We do this so that we can separate the query logic from the data ingestion (copy) logic.
To be able to run this file separately, we need to add it to the `bin` directory, one level below the
`src` directory.
:::

### Q1: Which user has the most followers? And how many followers do they have?

We first use the `MATCH` query to find the relationship specified. In this case, we want to retrieve
the `User` node `u2` at the end of the relation `FOLLOWS`:
```rs
let mut result1 = conn.query(
    "
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User) 
RETURN u2.username
LIMIT 5
",
)?;
println!("{}", result1.display());
```

Returns:
```
u2.username
coolwolf752
stormfox762
stormninja678
darkdog878
brightninja683
```

For more information on `MATCH`, please refer to our documentation in [Cypher Manual](/cypher/#index).

For each relation `FOLLOWS`, this will return the followee's username of that relation. While this doesn't provide much useful information yet, we may improve on this query by using aggregation.

We can then use aggregation function to count the number of appearnces of a followee, by adding `count(u2) as follower_count` to the `RETURN` statement:
```rs
let mut result2 = conn.query(
    "
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User) 
RETURN u2.username, count(u2) as follower_count
LIMIT 5
",
)?;
println!("{}", result2.display());
```
Returns
```
u2.username|follower_count
coolwolf752|3
stormfox762|5
stormcat597|2
brightninja683|5
stormqueen831|4
```
This is a lot more useful! We can now clearly see how many followers each user has.

Lastly, we use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to order the usernames by their amount of followers, and
return only the first entry. This is the user we are looking for, and how many followers that user has:
```rs
let mut result3 = conn.query(
    "
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User) 
RETURN u2.username, count(u2) as follower_count 
ORDER BY follower_count DESC 
LIMIT 1
",
)?;
println!("{}", result3.display());
```
Returns:
```
u2.username|follower_count
stormninja678|6
```

### Q2: What is the shortest path between two users?
Another question which we might be interested in answering is finding the shortest path between two users. 
For example, how many follows does it take to get from user `silentguy245` to `epicwolf202`? 
1. We can query this by using [recursive match](/cypher/query-clauses/match) to find shortest path length:
```rs
result = conn.query("
    MATCH p = (u1:user)-[f:FOLLOWS* SHORTEST 1..4]->(u2:User)
    WHERE u1.username = 'silentguy245' 
    AND u2.username = 'epicwolf202'
    RETURN p
    ")?;
println!("{}", result.display());
```
Returns:
```
{_NODES: [{_ID: 0:19, _LABEL: User, user_id: 20, username: silentguy245, account_creation_date: 2022-10-11},{_ID: 0:14, _LABEL: User, user_id: 15, username: mysticwolf198, account_creation_date: 2021-01-04},{_ID: 0:0, _LABEL: User, user_id: 1, username: epicwolf202, account_creation_date: 2022-09-09}], _RELS: [(0:19)-{_LABEL: FOLLOWS, _ID: 2:64}->(0:14),(0:14)-{_LABEL: FOLLOWS, _ID: 2:47}->(0:0)]}
```
This will return us a result of the `RECURSIVE_REL` datatype, which is diffcult to interpret.

To make this more useful, let's collect the interesting parts in the result by using [recursive relationship functions](/cypher/expressions/recursive-rel-functions)
```rs
let mut result = conn.query(
    "
MATCH p = (u1:user)-[f:FOLLOWS* SHORTEST 1..4]->(u2:User)
WHERE u1.username = 'silentguy245' 
AND u2.username = 'epicwolf202'
RETURN properties(nodes(p), 'username')
",
)?;
println!("{}", result.display());
```
Returns:
```
PROPERTIES(NODES(p),username)
[silentguy245,mysticwolf198,epicwolf202]
```

This is a lot more useful! We can now clearly see the shortest path between the two users with one
user, `mysticwolf198`, in between them.

### Q3: How many 3-hop paths exist between userA and userB that passes through userC?

To answer this query, we can follow a similar approach to Q1. We first match all 3-hop queries:

```rs
let mut result = conn.query(
    "
MATCH (u1:User)-[f1:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)-[f2:Follows]->(u3:User)-[f3:FOLLOWS]->(u4:User)
RETURN count(u4)
",
)?;
println!("{}", result.display());
```
Returns:
```
COUNT(u4._ID)
667
```
This tells us that there are 667 paths of length 3 in the graph.

### Run a prepared statement

Next, we add to the query to match only cases concerning with userA, userB, and userC. In this case,
we want to introduce the idea of [prepared statements](/get-started/prepared-statements/),
so that we can easily swap out elements of the query for other users. We arbitrarily choose userA to
be `epicwolf202`, userB to be `stormcat597`,
and userC to be `stormfox762`.

```rs
let u1 = "epicwolf202";
let u2 = "stormcat597";
let u3 = "stormfox762";
let query = format!(
    "
    MATCH (u1:User)-[f1:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)-[f2:Follows]->(u3:User)-[f3:FOLLOWS]->(u4:User)
    WHERE u1.username= '{}' AND u4.username= '{}' AND (u2.username= '{}' OR u3.username= '{}')
    RETURN count(u4)
    ",
    u1, u2, u3, u3
);
let mut result = conn.query(&query)?;
println!("{}", result.display());
```
Returns:
```
COUNT(u4._ID)
1
```
This tells us that there is exactly one path of length 3 between the three users specified.

## Summary
In summary, we've shown how to use Kuzu's Rust API to view our data as a graph, query it in Cypher,
and output the results in various formats.

Try these methods out on your own datasets, and have fun using Kuzu!

## Code

To reproduce the above tutorial, you can copy-paste the following code into their respective files.
Note that to run the `query.rs` file separately from the `main.rs` (that creates and copies data to the database),
you need to run the `main.rs` file first to create the database, and store the query file
in the path `bin/query.rs`.

```bash
# Copy data from CSV files to the database
cargo run --bin social_network_rs

# Run queries on the database
cargo run --bin query
```
