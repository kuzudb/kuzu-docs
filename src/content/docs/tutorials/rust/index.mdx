This tutorial will get you started using Kuzu's Rust API to analyze a dataset.

In this tutorial, we will use the following social network dataset that consists of users and their posts.

<LinkCard
  title="Example dataset"
  description="Social network dataset used in this tutorial"
  href="/tutorials/example-database"
/>

## Setup

Ensure that you have Rust [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) on your system.
Create a new Cargo project with Kuzu as a dependency:

```bash
cargo new kuzu_social_network
cd kuzu_social_network
cargo add kuzu
```

Next, [download the zipped data](https://kuzudb.com/data/tutorial/tutorial_data.zip) and unzip the files.
```bash
curl -o tutorial_data.zip https://kuzudb.com/data/tutorial/tutorial_data.zip
unzip tutorial_data.zip
rm tutorial_data.zip
```

Before we can start querying the data, we need to create a new Kuzu database
and import the CSV files. Since this is a one-time operation, we will use a
separate Cargo target.

Create a new file called `create_db.rs` inside `src/bin`:
```rs
mkdir src/bin
cp src/main.rs src/bin/create_db.rs
```

Your directory should now look something like this:
```
kuzu_social_network
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   ├── bin
│   │   └── create_db.rs
│   └── main.rs
└── tutorial_data
    ├── node
    │   ├── post.csv
    │   └── user.csv
    └── relation
        ├── FOLLOWS.csv
        ├── LIKES.csv
        └── POSTS.csv
```

Test the setup by running the Cargo target programs. Note that the first
`cargo run` will take some time as it [compiles Kuzu from scratch](https://docs.rs/kuzu/latest/kuzu/).
The second and subsequent runs should be faster.
```bash
$ cargo run --bin kuzu_social_network
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3m 18s
     Running `target/debug/kuzu_social_network`

$ cargo run --bin create_db
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.14s
     Running `target/debug/create_db`
```

We are now ready to start the tutorial.

## Create the database

Replace the contents of `src/bin/create_db.rs` with the following code snippet:
```rs
use kuzu::{Connection, Database, Error, SystemConfig};

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Rest of the code goes here.

    Ok(())
}
```

Create and connect to an empty Kuzu database:
```rs
let db = Database::new("social_network.kuzu", SystemConfig::default())?;
let conn = Connection::new(&db)?;
```
This will create a database `social_network.kuzu` where the imported CSV data will be stored.

Kuzu also supports an `in-memory` mode where the database is active only during the execution of the Rust program. For more information, refer to the example in the [create your first graph](/get-started) section.

### Define schema
The first step in building a Kuzu graph is to define a schema. For our example dataset, we need the following node and relationships tables:
```rs
conn.query(
    "CREATE NODE TABLE User(
        user_id INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
        username STRING,
        account_creation_date DATE
    )",
)?;
conn.query(
    "CREATE NODE TABLE Post(
        post_id INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
        post_date DATE,
        like_count INT64,
        retweet_count INT64
    )",
)?;
conn.query(
    "CREATE REL TABLE FOLLOWS(
        FROM User TO User
    )",
)?;
conn.query(
    "CREATE REL TABLE POSTS(
        FROM User TO Post
    )",
)?;
conn.query(
    "CREATE REL TABLE LIKES(
        FROM User TO Post
    )",
)?;
```

### Import CSV data

We can now import the CSV data into the node and relationship tables:
```rs
conn.query("COPY User FROM './tutorial_data/node/user.csv'")?;
conn.query("COPY Post FROM './tutorial_data/node/post.csv'")?;
conn.query("COPY FOLLOWS FROM './tutorial_data/relation/FOLLOWS.csv'")?;
conn.query("COPY POSTS FROM './tutorial_data/relation/POSTS.csv'")?;
conn.query("COPY LIKES FROM './tutorial_data/relation/LIKES.csv'")?;
```
See the documentation on [importing data](/import/csv) for more details on the parameters for CSV import.

### Show table information

Finally, we can print out a list of tables:
```rs
let result = conn.query("CALL SHOW_TABLES() RETURN *")?;
println!("{}", result);
```
### Running the code

Run `create_db.rs` to create the Kuzu database and import the CSV files:
```bash
$ cargo run --bin create_db
id|name|type|database name|comment
0|User|NODE|local(kuzu)|
1|Post|NODE|local(kuzu)|
3|FOLLOWS|REL|local(kuzu)|
5|POSTS|REL|local(kuzu)|
7|LIKES|REL|local(kuzu)|
```
The CSV data has been copied into a new Kuzu database in `social_network.kuzu`.

:::note[Note]
If you run the program again, you'll get an error about duplicated primary keys.
This is because the data has already been imported into the Kuzu database. You
will have to delete the database file (i.e. `rm social_network.kuzu`)
in between runs.
:::

## Query the graph

We can now start querying the graph to answer some questions about the social network.

Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following code snippet:
```rs
use kuzu::{Connection, Database, Error, SystemConfig, Value};

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let db = Database::new("social_network.kuzu", SystemConfig::default())?;
    let conn = Connection::new(&db)?;

    // Rest of the code goes here.

    Ok(())
}
```

Then for each of the following queries, type in the code and run the program as:
```bash
cargo run --bin kuzu_social_network
```

### Q1: Which user has the most followers? And how many followers do they have?

First, we use a simple `MATCH` query to list some users who are followed by some other user:
```rs
let result1 = conn.query(
    "MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
    RETURN u2.username
    LIMIT 5",
)?;
println!("{}", result1);
```

Returns:
```
u2.username
coolwolf752
stormfox762
stormninja678
darkdog878
brightninja683
```

For each relation `FOLLOWS`, this will simply return the followee's username of that relation. Next, we will improve on this query by using aggregation.

Let's count the number of appearances of a followee by using the `COUNT()` function:
```rs
let result2 = conn.query(
    "MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
    RETURN u2.username, COUNT(u2) AS follower_count
    LIMIT 5",
)?;
println!("{}", result2);
```
Returns
```
u2.username|follower_count
coolwolf752|3
stormfox762|5
stormcat597|2
brightninja683|5
stormqueen831|4
```
This is a lot more useful! We can now clearly see how many followers each user has.

Lastly, we use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to order the usernames by their followers count, and
return only the first entry. This is one of the users we are looking for, including the count of how many followers that user has:
```rs
let result3 = conn.query(
    "MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
    RETURN u2.username, COUNT(u2) AS follower_count
    ORDER BY follower_count DESC
    LIMIT 1",
)?;
println!("{}", result3);
```
Returns:
```
u2.username|follower_count
stormninja678|6
```

This dataset has multiple users with the greatest follower count of `6`. So, we are
excluding other users with the same follower count as `stormninja678` (or whoever appeared first).
If you want to retrieve all of them, the query becomes a bit longer:
```cypher
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
WITH u2, COUNT(u1) as follower_count
WITH MAX(follower_count) as max_count
MATCH (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
WITH u2, COUNT(u1) as follower_count, max_count
WHERE follower_count = max_count
RETURN u2.username, follower_count
```

### Q2: What is the shortest path between two users?
We might also be interested in finding the shortest path between two users.
For example, how many follows does it take to get from user `silentguy245` to `epicwolf202`?

We can query this by using a [recursive match](/cypher/query-clauses/match) to find the shortest path length:
```rs
let result4 = conn.query(
    "MATCH p = (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS* SHORTEST]->(u2:User)
    WHERE u1.username = 'silentguy245'
    AND u2.username = 'epicwolf202'
    RETURN p",
)?;
println!("{}", result4);
```
Returns:
```
{_NODES: [{_ID: 0:19, _LABEL: User, user_id: 20, username: silentguy245, account_creation_date: 2022-10-11},{_ID: 0:14, _LABEL: User, user_id: 15, username: mysticwolf198, account_creation_date: 2021-01-04},{_ID: 0:0, _LABEL: User, user_id: 1, username: epicwolf202, account_creation_date: 2022-09-09}], _RELS: [(0:19)-{_LABEL: FOLLOWS, _ID: 2:64}->(0:14),(0:14)-{_LABEL: FOLLOWS, _ID: 2:47}->(0:0)]}
```
This will return a result of the `RECURSIVE_REL` datatype, which as you can see is difficult to interpret.

To make this more useful, we will collect just the usernames in the path by using a [recursive relationship function](/cypher/expressions/recursive-rel-functions)
```rs
let result5 = conn.query(
    "MATCH p = (u1:User)-[f:FOLLOWS* SHORTEST]->(u2:User)
    WHERE u1.username = 'silentguy245'
    AND u2.username = 'epicwolf202'
    RETURN PROPERTIES(NODES(p), 'username')",
)?;
println!("{}", result5);
```
Returns:
```
PROPERTIES(NODES(p),username)
[silentguy245,mysticwolf198,epicwolf202]
```

This is much easier to read! We can now clearly see the shortest path between the two users with one
user, `mysticwolf198`, in between them.

### Q3: How many 3-hop paths exist between userA and userB that passes through userC?

To answer this query, we will follow a similar approach as Q1. We first count the number of 3-hop queries:

```rs
let result6 = conn.query(
    "MATCH (u1:User)-[f1:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)-[f2:Follows]->(u3:User)-[f3:FOLLOWS]->(u4:User)
    RETURN COUNT(u4)",
)?;
println!("{}", result6);
```
Returns:
```
COUNT(u4._ID)
667
```
This tells us that there are 667 paths of length 3 in the graph. Next, we use a prepared statement to construct queries involving particular users.

#### Run a prepared statement

We will now modify the query to only match paths with userA, userB, and userC.
Here, we will use [prepared statements](/get-started/prepared-statements/) to separate the query from its _parameters_.
We arbitrarily choose userA to be `epicwolf202`, userB to be `stormcat597`, and userC to be `stormfox762`.

```rs
let query =
    "MATCH (u1:User)-[f1:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)-[f2:Follows]->(u3:User)-[f3:FOLLOWS]->(u4:User)
    WHERE u1.username = $usersrc
    AND u4.username = $userdst
    AND (u2.username = $userint OR u3.username = $userint)
    RETURN COUNT(u4)";
let mut prepared_query = conn.prepare(query)?;
let usersrc = "epicwolf202";
let userdst = "stormcat597";
let userint = "stormfox762";
let params = vec![
    ("usersrc", Value::String(usersrc.to_string())),
    ("userdst", Value::String(userdst.to_string())),
    ("userint", Value::String(userint.to_string())),
];
let result7 = conn.execute(&mut prepared_query, params)?;
println!("{}", result7);
```
Returns:
```
COUNT(u4._ID)
1
```
This tells us that there is exactly one path of length 3 between the three users specified.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we've shown how to use Kuzu's Rust API to import CSV data as a graph and query it using Cypher.

You're now ready to import your own datasets into Kuzu and query them using Kuzu's Rust API!

## Code

Here's the full code from the tutorial that you can use to follow along. Reminder that you can run the code as follows:

```bash
# Copy data from CSV files to the database
cargo run --bin create_db

# Run queries on the database
cargo run --bin kuzu_social_network
```
