## Nodes

### `User`
The User node represents users within the social network. Each user has their information attached, such as:
- **user_id** (INT64): This is a unique ID which is used to sort and find users.
- **username** (STRING): This is the unique username which each user will have.
- **account_creation_date** (DATE): This represents the date which the account was created.
```
userID,username,account_creation_date
1,epicwolf202,2022-09-09
2,silentninja637,2023-01-27
3,stormcat597,2023-02-25
4,brightking765,2023-05-11
5,fastgirl798,2021-06-11
```

### `Post`
The Post node represents the posts which have been made on the social network. Each post has its information attached, such as:
- **post_id** (INT64): This is a unique ID which is used to sort and find posts.
- **creation_date** (DATE): This represents the date which the post was created.
- **like_count** (INT64): This represents the number of likes the post has received.
- **retweet_count** (INT64): This represents the number of retweets the post has received.
```
postID,creation_date,like_count,retweet_count
1,2021-12-08,427,29
2,2022-06-02,9,16
3,2023-01-14,238,51
4,2023-01-06,67,147
5,2022-10-26,103,73
```

## Relationships

### `FOLLOWS`
The relationship `FOLLOWS` goes from `User` node to `User` node. This relation represents a user following another user on the social network.
```
followerID,followeeID
1,7
1,6
2,17
2,10
2,13
```

### `POSTS`
The relationship `POSTS` goes from `User` node to `Post` node. This relation represents a user posting the post on the social network.
```
userID,postID
17,1
4,2
15,3
7,4
14,5
```

### `LIKES`
The relationship `LIKES` goes from `User` node to `Post` node. This relation represents a user liking the post on the social network.
```
userID,postID
16,1
2,1
4,1
13,1
11,1
```

## Create Kuzu tables

In the Kuzu CLI, let's create a node table for the `User`s in our dataset.

```cypher
// Create a node table for the `User`s in our dataset.
CREATE NODE TABLE User(
    userID INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
    username STRING,
    account_creation_date DATE
);

// Create a node table for the `Post`s in our dataset.
CREATE NODE TABLE Post(
    postID INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
    creation_date DATE,
    like_count INT64,
    retweet_count INT64
);

// Create a relationship table for the `FOLLOWS` relationship in our dataset.
CREATE REL TABLE FOLLOWS(From User To User);

// Create a relationship table for the `POSTS` relationship in our dataset.
CREATE REL TABLE POSTED(From User To Post);

// Create a relationship table for the `LIKES` relationship in our dataset.
CREATE REL TABLE LIKES(From User To Post);

```

This will create the required node and relationship tables in Kuzu.
