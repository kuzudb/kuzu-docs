Kuzu is an embedded graph database that can be used from the command line and from
a variety of programming languages. This page shows all the ways you can install Kuzu.
After installation, you can learn how to run Kuzu by [creating your first graph](/get-started).

## Command Line (Shell)

If you don't need Kuzu embedded in your application, you can use the CLI shell. This is a standalone
executable with no dependencies that can be used to interact with a Kuzu database using just Cypher.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux">

Use a tool like `curl` to download the latest version of the Kuzu CLI to your local machine.

```bash
# x86-64
curl -L -O https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/releases/download/v0.11.0/kuzu_cli-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
# aarch64
curl -L -O https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/releases/download/v0.11.0/kuzu_cli-linux-aarch64.tar.gz

tar xzf kuzu_cli-*.tar.gz
```

Now you can run Kuzu from the command line.

```bash
./kuzu
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">

You can install the Kuzu CLI using Homebrew.

```bash
brew install kuzu
```

You can now run Kuzu from the command line.

```bash
kuzu
```

Alternatively, you can download the Kuzu CLI directly.

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/releases/download/v0.11.0/kuzu_cli-osx-universal.tar.gz
tar xzf kuzu_cli-*.tar.gz
./kuzu
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows">

Use a tool like `curl` to download the latest version of the Kuzu CLI to your local machine. Alternatively,
simply open [this URL](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/releases/download/v0.11.0/kuzu_cli-windows-x86_64.zip)
in your browser.

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/releases/download/v0.11.0/kuzu_cli-windows-x86_64.zip
```

Right-click on the `kuzu_cli-xxx.zip` file and click on **Extract All**. This will create a directory
containing a file named `kuzu.exe`. Then, right-click on the directory and click "Open in terminal".
From within the terminal, you can then run `./kuzu.exe`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Nix">

On Linux, macOS, and WSL2, you can also use [`Nix`](https://nixos.org/learn) to run the Kuzu CLI.

Run Kuzu in a temporary shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p kuzu
kuzu
```

Alternatively, you can install Kuzu declaratively using [NixOS](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-package-management) or [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configuration:

```nix
{
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.kuzu ]; // NixOS
  home.packages = [ pkgs.kuzu ];              // Home Manager
}
```

## Python

You can use `uv`, `pip`, or `nix` to install the Kuzu Python client library.
The instructions are the same for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="uv">

```bash
uv init
uv add kuzu
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pip">

```bash
pip install kuzu
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="nix">

```bash
nix-shell -p "python3.withPackages (ps: [ ps.kuzu ])"
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Node.js

Use `npm` to install the Kuzu Node.js client library.

```bash
npm install kuzu
```

## Java

The latest stable version is available on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.kuzudb/kuzu).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kuzudb</groupId>
    <artifactId>kuzu</artifactId>
    <version>0.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Rust

Use Cargo to install the Kuzu Rust client library. This will by default build and statically link Kuzu's C++
library from source. You can also link against the dynamic release libraries, as described in the [crate docs](https://docs.rs/kuzu/latest/kuzu/#building).

```bash
cargo add kuzu
```

## Go

Kuzu's Go API is a wrapper around the C API of Kuzu. The installation step below assumes that you have
initialized a Go project that has a `go.mod` file, as described in [the official tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module).

```bash
go get github.com/kuzudb/go-kuzu
```

## Swift

To add `kuzu-swift` to your Swift project, you can use the Swift package manager.

Add `.package(url: "https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu-swift/", branch: "v0.11.0")` to your `Package.swift` dependencies.

Alternatively, you can add the package through Xcode:
1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Go to `File` > `Add Packages Dependencies...`.
3. Enter the URL of the kuzu-swift repository: `https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu-swift`.
4. Select the version you want to use (e.g., `main` branch or a specific tag).


## C/C++

Use a tool like `curl` to download the latest version of the Kuzu C/C++ binaries to your local machine.

The Kuzu C++ client is distributed as a so/dylib/dll+lib library file along with a header file (`kuzu.hpp`).
Once you've downloaded and extracted the C++ files into a directory, you can link it to your C++
program by adding the directory to your build system's search paths.
