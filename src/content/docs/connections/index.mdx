Kùzu is an embedded database that is designed for performance, scalability and ease of use. If
you've used conventional client-server databases, you may be used to connecting to a remote server
from your application via something like a REST API. In Kùzu, however, you connect directly to the
database directory on disk (in-memory mode is coming soon, but similar principles apply).

## `READ_WRITE` connections

The default connection mode is `READ_WRITE`, meaning that you can read and write data to the database
directory. This is the most common mode of operation when you're getting started with your project and
building your graphs.

The convention is to start a `Database` instance and create a `Connection` object that you can use
to interact with the database. To create a `READ_WRITE` connection, you'd use the following code:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python
db = kuzu.Database("./db")
conn = kuzu.Connection(db)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Node.js">

```javascript
const db = new kuzu.Database("./db");
const conn = new kuzu.Connection(db);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Java">

```java
KuzuDatabase db = new KuzuDatabase("./db", 0);
KuzuConnection conn = new KuzuConnection(db);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
let db = Database::new("./db", SystemConfig::default())?;
let conn = Connection::new(&db)?;
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
auto config = SystemConfig();
auto database = Database("db", config);
auto connection = Connection(database);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="C">

```c
kuzu_database *db = kuzu_database_init("./db", config);
kuzu_connection *conn = kuzu_connection_init(db);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## `READ_ONLY` connections

Once you have data inserted into your database, you can create multiple `READ_ONLY` connections
to your database to query the data. You can have multiple `READ_ONLY` connections to the same database
open and query the data concurrently. To create a `READ_ONLY` connection, you'd use the following code:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python
db = kuzu.Database("./db", read_only=True)
conn = kuzu.Connection(db)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Node.js">

```javascript
const db = new kuzu.Database("./db", { readOnly: true });
const conn = new kuzu.Connection(db);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Java">

pass readOnly as true to the database connector.

```java
KuzuDatabase db = new KuzuDatabase("./db", 0, true, false);
KuzuConnection conn = new KuzuConnection(db);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust">

```rust
let db = Database::new("./db", SystemConfig::default().read_only(true))?;
let conn = Connection::new(&db)?;
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
auto config = SystemConfig();
config.readOnly = true;
auto database = Database("db", config);
auto connection = Connection(database);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="C">

```c
kuzu_database *db = kuzu_database_init("./db", config);
kuzu_connection *conn = kuzu_connection_init(db);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::danger[Note]
You cannot have a `READ_WRITE` connection
open to the database while you have `READ_ONLY` connections open -- see the next section on
[concurrency](/connections/concurrency) for more information.
