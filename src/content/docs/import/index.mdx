There are multiple ways to import data in Kùzu. The only prerequisite for inserting data
into a database is that you first create a graph schema, i.e., the structure of your node and relationship tables.

For small graphs (a few thousand nodes), the `CREATE` and `MERGE` [Cypher clauses](../cypher/data-manipulation-clauses)
can be used to insert nodes and
relationships. These are similar to SQL's `INSERT` statements, but bear in mind that they are slower than the bulk import
options shown below. The `CREATE`/`MERGE` clauses are intended to do small additions or updates on a sporadic basis.

In general, the recommended approach is to use `COPY FROM` (rather than creating or
merging nodes one by one), for larger graphs of millions of nodes and beyond. For now, the `COPY FROM`
commands can only be used when tables are empty.

## `COPY FROM` CSV

The `COPY FROM` command is used to bulk import data from a CSV file into a node or relationship table.
See the linked card below for more information and examples.

## `COPY FROM` Parquet

Similar to CSV, the `COPY FROM` command is used to bulk import data from a Parquet file into a node or relationship table.
See the linked card below for more information and examples.

## `COPY FROM` NumPy

Importing from NumPy is a specific use case that allows you to import numeric data from a NumPy file into a node table.
