Kùzu is embeddable in a variety of languages via client library APIs. Queries in Kùzu through via
its CLI or client APIs are transactional, satisfying serializability, atomicity and durability requirements.

## Official clients

The following client libraries are officially supported.

## Best practices

:::caution[Note]

This note pertains to those **connecting to the same database directory via multiple `Database` instances.**

Each way ultimately creates a `Database` instance in C++ (Kùzu's CLI is written in C++, so is a C++
process, and Kùzu's Python API, through which you create a `PyDatabase` instance is a binding to Kùzu's C++ API
and so ultimately creates a `Database` instance. Similar for other language APIs). Each database you create is identified by its directory. 
While it's possible to create multiple `Database` instances that connect to the same database directory, you should only issue read queries in such scenarios.
This is because writes from one `Database` instance will not be visible to another, leading to potential database corruption.

As of now, Kùzu does not ensure that you are connecting to the same database directory through a single `Database` instance.
That being said, *you're free to open multiple connections to the same database from the same `Database` instance.*
But as a best practice, you shouldn't concurrently have a CLI open that writes to a database directory and multiple separate processes or threads
that read from the same database in the same directory, for the above mentioned reasons.
