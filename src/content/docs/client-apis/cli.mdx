description: Through the CLI, you can issue Cypher queries or call shell commands.
---

K첫zu provides a CLI shell through which you can issue Cypher queries or `CALL` commands to query
metadata. See the [installation](/installation) docs for instructions on how
to install the CLI and the [quick start](/get-started) page for its basic usage.

## Start the shell

Navigate to the directory where the K첫zu CLI is located and run the following command:

```bash
./kuzu <db_path>
```

Where `<db_path>` is the directory for the database files. 
This path can point to an existing database or a yet-to-be-created directory, in which case
K첫zu will automatically create the directory and initialize an empty database for you.

You can view the additional shell startup flags by running `./kuzu -h`.

```bash
$ ./kuzu -h
  ./kuzu [databasePath] {OPTIONS}

    KuzuDB Shell

  OPTIONS:

      databasePath                      Database path.
      -h, --help                        Display this help menu
      -d, --default_bp_size,
      --defaultbpsize                   Size of buffer pool for default and
                                        large page sizes in megabytes
      --no_compression, --nocompression Disable compression
      -r, --read_only, --readonly       Open database at read-only mode.
      -p, --path_history                Path to directory for shell history
      -v, --version                     Display current database version
      "--" can be used to terminate flag options and force all following
      arguments to be treated as positional options
```

## Shell commands

Once you start the shell, you can issue Cypher queries as shown in the [get started](/get-started)
section, or call any of the shell commands listed below.

#### `:help`
Show built-in command list within the K첫zu shell.

```
kuzu> :help
    :help     get command list
    :clear     clear shell
    :quit     exit from shell
    :max_rows [max_rows]     set maximum number of rows for display (default: 20)
    :max_width [max_width]     set maximum width in characters for display

    Note: you can change and see several system configurations, such as num-threads, 
          timeout, and progress_bar using Cypher CALL statements.
          e.g. CALL THREADS=5; or CALL current_setting('threads') return *;
          See: https://docs.kuzudb.com/cypher/configuration
```

#### `:clear`
Clear shell. Alternatively, you can use `Ctrl + L` to clear the shell.

#### `:quit`
Exit from shell. Alternatively, you can use `Ctrl + D` to exit the shell.

#### `:max_rows [max_rows]`
Set maximum number of rows for display. 0 defaults to 20.

#### `:max_width [max_width]`
Set maximum width in characters for display. Defaults to terminal width if unable to display first and last columns. 

## Interrupt shell
To interrupt a running query, use `Ctrl + C` in CLI. Note: We currently don't support interrupting `COPY` statement.

## Non-interactive usage
To read and process a file in non-interactive mode, pipe the file content to the CLI.

```bash
./kuzu testdb < tinysnb/schema.cypher
---------------------------------------
| outputMsg                           |
---------------------------------------
| NodeTable: person has been created. |
```
