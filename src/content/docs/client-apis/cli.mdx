description: Through the CLI, you can issue Cypher queries or call shell commands.
---

Kùzu provides a CLI shell through which you can issue Cypher queries or `CALL` commands to query
metadata. See the [installation](/installation) docs for instructions on how
to install the CLI and the [quick start](/get-started) page for its basic usage.

## Start the shell

Navigate to the directory where the Kùzu CLI is located and run the following command:

```bash
./kuzu <db_path>
```

Where `<db_path>` is the directory for the database files. 
This path can point to an existing database or a yet-to-be-created directory, in which case
Kùzu will automatically create the directory and initialize an empty database for you.

You can view the additional shell startup flags by running `./kuzu -h`.

```bash
$ ./kuzu -h
  ./kuzu [databasePath] {OPTIONS}

    KuzuDB Shell

  OPTIONS:

      databasePath                      Database path.
      -h, --help                        Display this help menu
      -d, --default_bp_size,
      --defaultbpsize                   Size of buffer pool for default and
                                        large page sizes in megabytes
      --no_compression, --nocompression Disable compression
      -r, --read_only, --readonly       Open database at read-only mode.
      -p, --path_history                Path to directory for shell history
      -v, --version                     Display current database version
      -i, --init                        Path to file with script to run on
                                        startup
      -m, --mode                        Set the output mode of the shell
      -s, --no_stats, --nostats         Disable query stats
      "--" can be used to terminate flag options and force all following
      arguments to be treated as positional options
```

## Shell commands

Once you start the shell, you can issue Cypher queries as shown in the [get started](/get-started)
section, or call any of the shell commands listed below. Frequently used configurations can be stored in the `.kuzurc` file,
which is executed on startup of the CLI client. See the [startup commands](#startup-commands) section below for more details.

#### `:help`
Show built-in command list within the Kùzu shell.

```
kuzu> :help
    :help     get command list
    :clear     clear shell
    :quit     exit from shell
    :max_rows [max_rows]     set maximum number of rows for display (default: 20)
    :max_width [max_width]     set maximum width in characters for display
    :mode [mode]     set output mode (default: box)
    :stats [on|off]     toggle query stats on or off

    Note: you can change and see several system configurations, such as num-threads, 
          timeout, and progress_bar using Cypher CALL statements.
          e.g. CALL THREADS=5; or CALL current_setting('threads') return *;
          See: https://docs.kuzudb.com/cypher/configuration
```

#### `:clear`
Clear shell. Alternatively, you can use `Ctrl + L` to clear the shell.

#### `:quit`
Exit from shell. Alternatively, you can use `Ctrl + D` to exit the shell.

#### `:max_rows [max_rows]`
Set maximum number of rows for display. 0 defaults to 20.

#### `:max_width [max_width]`
Set maximum width in characters for display. Defaults to terminal width if unable to display first and last columns. 

#### `:mode [mode]`
Set output mode. The default mode is `box`. See the output modes section below for more details.

#### `:stats [on|off]`
Toggle query statistics on or off. The default is `on`. Query statistics include the number of tuples, columns, and execution time.

## Interrupt shell

To interrupt a running query, use `Ctrl + C` in CLI. Note: We currently don't support interrupting a running `COPY` statement.

## Non-interactive usage

You can also read and process a file in non-interactive mode via the CLI.
Consider that you have the following DDL file:

```cypher
// schema.cypher
CREATE NODE TABLE Person (name STRING, age INT64, PRIMARY KEY(name));
COPY Person FROM 'person.csv';
```

Pipe the file content to the CLI as follows:

```bash
./kuzu testdb < schema.cypher
```
```
Opened the database at path: ./test_db in read-write mode.
Enter ":help" for usage hints.
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ result                         │

├────────────────────────────────┤
│ Table Person has been created. │
└────────────────────────────────┘

├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4 tuples have been copied to the Person table. │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
(1 tuple)
(1 column)
Time: 0.09ms (compiling), 11.75ms (executing)
```

## Query progress

For queries that might take a significant amount of time to execute, a progress bar can be enabled that displays
the number of pipelines that have been executed (each query is broken down into one or more pipelines), 
as well as the percentage of the data processed in a pipeline. This gives an estimate for how much of a pipeline
has executed.

![](/img/progress-bar.gif)

The progress bar is not enabled by default. To enable the progress bar, use the following command:

```cypher
CALL progress_bar=true;
```

To further configure the progress bar, see the [configuration](/cypher/configuration) section.

## Startup commands

On startup, the CLI will look for a file named `.kuzurc` and execute all commands in the file, including all commands and Cypher statements.
This file can be used to set up the shell environment, such as setting the maximum number of rows to display or changing the mode.
You can also point to a different initialization file using the `--init` flag.

For example, the following `.kuzurc` file sets the output mode to `csv` and turns query statistics off:

```cypher
// .kuzurc
:mode csv
:stats off
```

This outputs: 
```bash
$ ./kuzu testdb
-- Loading resources from .kuzurc
mode set as csv
stats set as off
Opened the database at path: testdb in read-write mode.
Enter ":help" for usage hints.
kuzu> 
```

## Output modes
The `:mode [mode]` command allows you to change the appearance of the tables returned by queries.
To view the available modes, use the `:mode` command without any arguments:

```
kuzu> :mode
Available output modes:
    box (default):    Tables using unicode box-drawing characters
    column:    Output in columns
    csv:    Comma-separated values
    html:    HTML table
    json:    Results in a JSON array
    jsonlines:    Results in a NDJSON format
    latex:    LaTeX tabular environment code
    line:    One value per line
    list:    Values delimited by "|"
    markdown:    Markdown table
    table:    Tables using ASCII characters
    tsv:    Tab-separated values
    trash:    No output
```

To change the output mode, use the `:mode` command followed by the desired mode:

```cypher
kuzu> :mode json
mode set as json
kuzu> CREATE NODE TABLE Person (name STRING, age INT64, PRIMARY KEY(name));
[{"result":"Table Person has been created."}]
```

The `:max_rows` and `:max_width` commands can be used to control the number of rows and the width
of the `box`, `column`, `table`, and `markdown` output modes.
