Elixir is a programming language based on the BEAM virtual environment.
Its functional style, strong community, Erlang compatibility and concurrency-friendly
features, like preemptive scheduling and spawning a large number of process without incurring much overhead,
make it a popular choice among developers for building full-stack applications.

In Elixir, a NIF (Native Implemented Function) is a function written in a native language (in this case, Rust)
that can be called directly from Elixir code, allowing developers to leverage high-performance, low-level
operations within their Elixir applications, essentially providing a way to extend the functionality of the
Erlang BEAM virtual machine by executing code outside of its standard runtime environment.

The NIF package is maintained as an independent, external open source project contributed by [Kineviz, Inc](https://www.kineviz.com/).
Please reach out to the package's maintainer per the link above if you have more questions.
