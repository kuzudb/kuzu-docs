The Ruby client is an independent, external project created by third-party contributors.
You can find its API docs by clicking on the link card below, which takes you directly to the
RubyGems page for `ruby-kuzu`.

Please contact the maintainer or post an issue on the project's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ged/ruby-kuzu) if you have any issues using this API.
