import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[yFiles Jupyter Graphs for Kuzu](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-jupyter-graphs-for-kuzu) is an
open source Jupyter notebook widget that allows you to visualize Kuzu graphs from inside your Jupyter notebooks.
It leverages the larger *yFiles Jupyter Graphs* ecosystem from [yWorks](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-graphs-for-jupyter).

When working interactively in Python, it's common to use the `ipykernel` package to open a Jupyter
kernel in your IDE like VSCode or Cursor. Alternatively, a lot of users prefer to use Jupyter Lab,
an interactive computing environment for Python. The yFiles Jupyter Graphs widget is designed for these
use cases, allowing users working in Python to visualize Kuzu graphs in their Jupyter notebooks. See
[their GitHub page](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-jupyter-graphs/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-environments)
for a list of supported environments.

## Installation

The yFiles Jupyter Graphs widget can be installed using `uv` or `pip`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="uv">

```bash
# Install kuzu as a pre-requisite
uv init
uv add kuzu yfiles-jupyter-graphs-for-kuzu
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pip">

```bash
# Install kuzu as a pre-requisite
pip install kuzu yfiles-jupyter-graphs-for-kuzu
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create a graph

Let's create a graph of well-known physicists and their relationships. There is one node
table `Person`, and one relationship table `MENTORED`, which describes who mentored whom.
Each person has a `name` and an `alias`, which is the name they are best known by.

```py
import kuzu
from yfiles_jupyter_graphs_for_kuzu import KuzuGraphWidget
# Open a new in-memory database
db = kuzu.Database()
conn = kuzu.Connection(db)
# Create tables
conn.execute("CREATE NODE TABLE Person(name STRING PRIMARY KEY, alias STRING)")
conn.execute("CREATE REL TABLE MENTORED(FROM Person TO Person)")
# Insert data
conn.execute("""
    MERGE (a:Person {name: "John Strutt", alias: "Lord Rayleigh"})
    MERGE (b:Person {name: "Joseph Thomson", alias: "JJ Thomson"})
    MERGE (c:Person {name: "Ernest Rutherford", alias: "Ernest Rutherford"})
    MERGE (d:Person {name: "Niels Bohr", alias: "Niels Bohr"})
    MERGE (e:Person {name: "Christian Christiansen", alias: "Christian Christiansen"})
    MERGE (a)-[:MENTORED]->(b)
    MERGE (b)-[:MENTORED]->(c)
    MERGE (b)-[:MENTORED]->(d)
    MERGE (c)-[:MENTORED]->(d)
    MERGE (d)-[:MENTORED]->(e)
""")
```

## Display graph with default layout

Once the data is in the graph, you can create a yFiles Jupyter Graphs widget to visualize it.
The `show_cypher` method takes a Cypher query and displays the result as a graph inside the Jupyter
notebook.

```py
# Create a widget instance using the existing connection
g = KuzuGraphWidget(conn)
# Display the entire graph
g.show_cypher("MATCH (a)-[b]->(c) RETURN * LIMIT 100")
```
<img src="/img/visualization/yfiles/yfiles-1.png"/>

The widget will display the entire graph, with all nodes and relationships in the default layout.

:::caution[Limit the number of results]
The yFiles Jupyter Graphs widget is not designed to display a large number of nodes and relationships.
It uses Kuzu's Python API under the hood to fetch the data as Python objects, which can be slow for
large graphs. As a result, we recommend limiting the number of results returned by the Cypher query
to a few hundred at most.
:::

## Display graph with custom layouts

The yFiles Jupyter Graphs widget supports a variety of layouts, which can be specified when
initializing the widget to always display the graph in a certain way.

In this case, because the relationships result in a tree structure, it can be useful to specify the
`tree` layout while initializing the widget. The query being run here is asking the question "Who are
the mentors of Christian Christiansen up to 2 degrees?".

```py
g2 = KuzuGraphWidget(conn, layout="tree")
# Match the mentors of Christian Christiansen up to 2 degrees
g2.show_cypher("MATCH (a:Person)-[r:MENTORED*1..2]->(b:Person {name: 'Christian Christiansen'}) RETURN *")
```
<img src="/img/visualization/yfiles/yfiles-2.png"/>

The result is displayed in the tree layout, with the mentors of Christian Christiansen at the root.

## Customize node appearance

With the `add_node_configuration` method, you can customize the appearance of nodes and relationships.

```py
# Custom configuration for nodes
g2.add_node_configuration(
    "Person",
    color="red",   # type: ignore
    text= lambda node : {   # type: ignore
        "text": node["properties"]["alias"],
        "position": "south",
    }
)  #

# Match the mentors of Christian Christiansen up to 2 degrees
g2.show_cypher("MATCH (a:Person)-[r:MENTORED*1..2]->(b:Person {name: 'Christian Christiansen'}) RETURN *")
```

The result is displayed with all nodes coloured red, and the alias of each person displayed at the
south of the node.

## Interactive layouts

Once the layout is generated, you can also change the layout interactively by clicking on the
layout button in the widget and picking from the available layouts. The example below shows the
"orthogonal" layout, which is a variation of the "tree" layout that is more compact and enforces
a grid structure.

```py
# Match the mentors of Christian Christiansen up to 3 degrees
g2.show_cypher("MATCH (a:Person)-[r:MENTORED*1..3]->(b:Person {name: 'Christian Christiansen'}) RETURN *")
```

You can experiment with different layouts and customizations to find the best way to visualize your
data on the fly!
