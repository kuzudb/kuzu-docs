title: Visualize graphs with G.V()
---

This page describes how to use [G.V()](https://gdotv.com/) , a third-party desktop application that
integrates with Kuzu to provide a rich set of visualization and analysis features for your graph data.

:::note[When is it beneficial to use G.V()?]
If you're working with larger graphs and want to visualize
thousands of nodes and relationships, G.V() is a good choice, because it renders the graph
via WebGL, which is much faster than the default Kuzu Explorer.

## Obtain a license key

G.V() requires a license key to use (for a modest fee). To obtain a license, you can visit their [pricing page](https://gdotv.com/buy)
and purchase a license.

## Key features

G.V()â€™s Kuzu Cypher query editor offers a powerful suite of features to accelerate and enhance you
query writing experience, by offering essential development features:

- Cypher syntax validation
- Autocomplete suggestions based on your graph data schema
- Embedded schema documentation so you can immediately identify the relevant labels and property keys for your nodes & edges
- Procedure autocomplete
- Query parameter support

## Installation

G.V() is a desktop application that can be installed on Windows, macOS and Linux. You can download the installer from their
[home page](https://gdotv.com).

## Connecting to Kuzu

G.V() directly connects to a local Kuzu database. First, open the G.V() application and click on the
"New Database Connection" button. You can select Kuzu from the list of supported databases as shown below.

The next step is to specify the path to the Kuzu database you want to connect to. Make
sure that you type in the absolute path to the database. By default, G.V() will try to
connect to the Kuzu database in read-write mode. If you want it to connect in read-only mode,
you can select the "Read Only" button shown. Once selected, you can click on "Test Connection"
to make sure that the connection is successful.

## View graph schema

You can view the graph schema by clicking on the "View Graph Data Model" button in the left sidebar.
This displays the graph schema in a convenient layout that shows the node labels, relationship labels
and their associated properties (and their data types).

## Query using Cypher

You're now ready to write and execute Cypher queries in G.V()! The default query is loaded in
the query editor, which can be executed by clicking on the "Play" button or pressing `Ctrl+Enter`
(or `Cmd+Enter` on macOS). You should see your graph data visualized in the main panel.

The default visualization is a graph of the results, if you choose to `RETURN *` or return nodes,
relationships, or paths from your query. You can also choose to visualize the results as a table
by returning the properties of the nodes or relationships.

## Advanced features

In addition to basic Cypher query editing, G.V() offers a richer set of features to help
you explore, debug and analyze your graph data. Below are some of the key features:

- **Query history**: Access your previous queries and quickly re-run them.
- **Save queries**: Save your queries for future use.
- **View query profile**: View Kuzu's internal query execution profile
- **Explain query**: Get a detailed explanation of the query plan and execution strategy
- **Custom graph layouts**: Choose from a variety of graph layouts to visualize your data
  - Force-directed layout (default)
  - Circular
  - Grid
  - Community layout
  - Tree layout (vertical and horizontal)


There are many more features to explore! Please see the
[release announcement post](https://gdotv.com/blog/gdotv-kuzu-release-announcement/) that details
all the important features along with examples.
