## Query editor

Using the Shell Panel, you can interactively issue queries to your loaded database
and visualize the results in several different views. You issue queries by using
the canvases on your screen, which have a red X and green play icon on the left side.
You write your query on the top of a canvas and when you click the play button or press Shift+Enter,
the query in the canvas is issued.
Below is a screenshot that asks a simple query that returns all of the relationships
and their source and destination nodes in the database. The results of the query can
be rendered in 3 possible ways.

First, query results can be rendered as a graph view as shown below.

There is a side panel in the graph view, which you can open and close to see the properties of
individual nodes and relationships you click on or hover over. The graph view is enabled
and is the default view if the query's `RETURN` statement contains node (and relationship) variables.
For example if the query about returned only the name property of `a` nodes, i.e.,
if the return statement was `RETURN a.name`, then you could not see the results in a graph view,
as the return values are only a column of strings. As long as one of the variables projected
in the `RETURN` statement is a node you will get by default a graph view.

Second, query results can be output as a table as shown below by clicking the table icon on the left hand
side of a canvas.

Finally query results can be output in JSON format as shown below by clicking the `</>` icon on the
left hand side of a canvas.

## Inspect node and relationship properties

If the displayed property on a node is too large to fit inside it, the text is truncated on the node
displayed in the graph view. There are two ways to gain more information about a node or relationship's
property values.

### Hover display

If you hover your cursor over a given node or relationship, you will see the node's properties displayed
in a box that appears over that node or relationship. The box disappears if the cursor moves away outside
the bounds of the entity. This mode is useful for a quick, cursory glance of a node's properties as
you're inspecting the graph at a high level.

### Expand right sidebar

For a full view of a node or relationship's property values, you can click on it. A sidebar will pop up on
the right side, which displays the property values in full, which is useful to gain a deeper understanding
of the data, including which field is the primary key (if it is a node).

## Query progress

For expensive queries that might take a significant amount of time to execute, a progress bar can be enabled that displays
the number of pipelines that have been executed (each query is broken down into one or more pipelines), 
as well as the percentage of the data processed in a pipeline. This gives an estimate for how much of a pipeline
has executed.

The progress bar is not enabled by default. To enable the progress bar, use the following command:

```cypher
CALL progress_bar=true;
```

To further configure the progress bar, see the [configuration](/cypher/configuration) section.

## LLM integration

The shell panel has an additional tab called "AI Query" that allows you to use LLMs from OpenAI or other OpenAI-compatible
APIs to generate Cypher queries from natural language.

### OpenAI models

To use OpenAI LLMs, navigate to the "Query Generation Options" section in the [settings](/cypher/visualization/kuzu-explorer/settings-panel) page,
and select the desired OpenAI model. Copy-paste your OpenAI API key into API key field as follows:

### Open-AI compatible endpoints

The shell panel supports Open-AI compatible endpoints that are not OpenAI models, for example, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
To use endpoints like these, select the "Open-AI compatible endpoint" option in the "Query Generation Options" section.
For open source models, no API key is needed. The screenshot below shows the settings for using Ollama with the `gemma3:27b` model
for query generation.

:::note[Note]
If you're using Docker Desktop, you may need to enable host networking to be able to access your locally running Ollama server
from within the Docker container that's running Kuzu Explorer. In Docker Desktop, go to "Settings", and then navigate to "Resources" > "Network" > "Enable host networking".
Once this is enabled, you should be able to run the following command and then open `http://localhost:8000` as normal.
```bash
# Run the following command to start Kuzu Explorer with host networking enabled
docker run --net=host --rm kuzudb/explorer:latest
```

### AI query generation

You can now use the AI Query tab to generate Cypher queries from natural language. Simply type in the natural language query and
run the cell. This will generate a Cypher query using the selected LLM, which you can inspect by clicking back on the "Cypher Query" tab.
Try out this feature if you're learning Cypher and want to work with an LLM to help you out!
