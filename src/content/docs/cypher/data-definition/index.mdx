title: Data definition language (DDL)
---

import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Data definition language (DDL) in K첫zu defines the commands and statments that create, alter,
and delete database objects. The schema provides a logical grouping of node and relationship tables
that define the structure of the graph database.

## Create (statement)

As a first step to creating your database, you need to define your node and directed relationships.
In the property graph model, nodes and relationships have labels. In K첫zu, every node or
relationship can have 1 label. The node and relationships and the predefined properties on them are
defined through `CREATE NODE TABLE` and `CREATE REL TABLE` statements.
The choice of using the term "table" over "label" is intentional and explained in the footnote below[^1].

## Alter

You can update the schema of a table using `ALTER TABLE`.

## Drop

You can drop tables from the database with the `DROP TABLE`.

[^1]: We prefer the term `TABLE` instead of `LABEL` because K첫zu, as well as other GDBMSs are
ultimately relational systems in the sense that they store and process sets of tuples, i.e., tables
or relations. In fact, K첫zu's data model can be viewed as a _structured_ property graph model, in
which you tag your tables as "node" and "relationship tables" depending on their roles in your
application data. Nodes are generally
suited for representing entities, while relationships are used to represent the
relationships/connections. Relationships are also the primary means to join nodes with each other to
find paths and patterns in your graph database. So when you sketch out a mental map of your
nodes/relationships, this is equivalent to defining your tables or records as nodes or relationships.
During querying you can bind node records in syntax like `(a:Person)`, while relationships in syntax
like `(..)-[e:Knows]->(...)`. Similar to table definitions in SQL, node and relationship tables have
primary keys, a term that is defined in the context of tables: node tables explicitly define
primary keys as one of their properties, while the primary keys of relationship tables are
implicitly defined by the primary keys of their FROM and TO node records. Further observe that
similar to relational systems, properties can be thought equivalently as columns of a table,
justifying our choice of using the term table in these definitions.
