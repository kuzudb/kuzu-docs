title: Data definition language (DDL)

import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Data definition language (DDL) in Kùzu defines the commands and statements that create, alter,
and delete database objects. The schema provides a logical grouping of node and relationship tables
that define the structure of the graph database.

## Create (statement)

As a first step to creating your database, you need to define your node and directed relationships.
In the property graph model, nodes and relationships have labels. In Kùzu, every node or
relationship can have one label. The node and relationships and the predefined properties on them are
defined through `CREATE NODE TABLE` and `CREATE REL TABLE` statements.
The choice of using the term "table" over "label" is intentional and explained below.

:::note[Why are there no "labels"?]
Kùzu uses the term **table** rather than **label** because, like other GDBMSs, Kùzu is
ultimately a relational system in the sense that it stores and processes sets of tuples, i.e., tables
or relations.

In fact, Kùzu's data model can be viewed as a _structured_ property graph model, in
which you tag your tables as "node" and "relationship" tables depending on their roles in your
application data. Nodes are generally
well-suited for representing entities, while relationships are used to represent the
connections between these entities. Relationships are also the primary means to *join* nodes with each other to
find paths and patterns in your graph database. So when you sketch out a mental map of your
nodes/relationships, it is equivalent to defining your records as nodes or relationship tables.

During querying you can bind node records with syntax like `(a:Person)`, and relationships with syntax
like `(..)-[e:Knows]->(...)`. Similar to table definitions in SQL, node and relationship tables have
primary keys, a term that is defined in the context of tables: node tables explicitly define
primary keys as one of their properties, while the primary keys of relationship tables are
implicitly defined by the primary keys of their `FROM` and `TO` node records. Furthermore
(similar to relational systems), properties can be thought of as equivalent to columns in a table,
justifying our choice of using the term "table" in our design of the system.

## Alter

You can update the schema of a table using `ALTER TABLE`.

## Drop

You can drop tables from the database with the `DROP TABLE`.
