title: Data definition language (DDL)
---

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Data definition language (DDL) in KÃ¹zu defines the commands and statements that create, alter,
and delete database objects. The schema provides a logical grouping of node and relationship tables,
along with their associated properties and data types that define the structure of the graph database.

## Create

The cards below highlight the various create statements you can use in DDL.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="CREATE TABLE" href="/cypher/data-definition/create-table"
    description="Create table statements"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Alter

You can update the schema of a table using `ALTER TABLE`.

<LinkCard
    title="ALTER" href="/cypher/data-definition/alter"
    description="Alter statements"
/>

## Drop

You can drop tables from the database with the `DROP TABLE`.

<LinkCard
    title="DROP" href="/cypher/data-definition/drop"
    description="Drop statements"
/>
