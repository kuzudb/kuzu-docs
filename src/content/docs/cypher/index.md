title: Cypher manual
---

Cypher is a high-level query language for the property graph data model.
It is similar to SQL in many aspects. Some of its analogues with SQL are shown below.

| Type | SQL | Cypher
| ---| --- | ---
| Query | `SELECT`/`FROM`/`WHERE` | `MATCH`/`WHERE`/`RETURN`
| Data manipulation | `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` | `CREATE`/`SET`/`REMOVE`

The features of Cypher that are different from SQL are listed below:
- Joins between records from different node and relationship tables are specified using a graph-like syntax.
  - `MATCH (n:Person)-[:Follows]->(m:Person)`
- Special syntax, such as the Kleene star `*` to describe variable-length and recursive joins.
- Cypher does not have an explicit `GROUP BY` like SQL does -- instead, grouping is done implicitly
depending on the combination of bound variables in the `RETURN` clause.

There are a few other differences between SQL and Cypher. Yet, like other high-level database
query languages, most of its semantics can be understood as mappings to relational algebra operators
for selections, joins, projections and aggregations.

Kùzu implements openCypher's[^1] standard predicates and expressions. The following sections in this
chapter covers all Cypher clauses, expressions and functions implemented in Kùzu.

semantics, style and grammar for the Cypher query language in order to make it more compatible to be
used by multiple graph database vendors.
