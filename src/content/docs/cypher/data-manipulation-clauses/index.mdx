import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Kuzu's implementation of openCypher provides `CREATE`/`SET`/`DELETE` commands to manipulate the
data in a database. As a general rule, these should be used to do small modifications to the database.
For doing large bulk insertions, you should use the `COPY FROM` commands as far as possible.
