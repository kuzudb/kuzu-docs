| + | addition of INTERVAL | `TIMESTAMP('2022-11-12 13:22:17') + INTERVAL('4 minutes, 3 hours, 2 days')` | `2022-11-14 17:22:21` (TIMESTAMP) | 
| - | subtraction of TIMESTAMP | `TIMESTAMP('2022-11-22 15:12:22') - TIMESTAMP('2011-10-09 13:00:21')` | `4062 days 02:12:01` (INTERVAL)|
| - | subtraction of INTERVAL | `TIMESTAMP('2011-10-21 14:25:13') - INTERVAL('35 days 2 years 3 hours')` | `2009-09-16 11:25:13` (TIMESTAMP) |
