Cypher supports the `LOAD FROM` clause to scan data from various sources. Scanning is the act of
reading data from a source, but _not inserting it_ into the database (inserting data into the database
involves "copying"; see the [Import data](/import) section for details).

Scanning data using `LOAD FROM` is very useful to inspect a subset of your data, understand its structure
and perform transformations like rearranging columns.

## General usage

Say you have a `user.csv` file that looks like this:

```csv
// user.csv
name,age
Adam,30
Karissa,40
Zhang,50
Noura,25
```

You can scan the file and print the first two rows to the console:
```cypher
LOAD FROM "ex_data/user.csv" (header = true)
RETURN COUNT(*);
```
This counts the number of rows in the file.
```
┌──────────────┐
│ COUNT_STAR() │
│ INT64        │
├──────────────┤
│ 4            │
└──────────────┘
```

You can also apply filter predicates via the `WHERE` clause, like this:
```cypher
LOAD FROM "ex_data/user.csv" (header = true)
WHERE age > 25
RETURN *;
```
The above query counts only the rows where the `age` column is greater than 25.
```
┌──────────────┐
│ COUNT_STAR() │
│ INT64        │
├──────────────┤
│ 3            │
└──────────────┘
```
Note that when scanning from from CSV files, all data is parsed as strings, but Kùzu will attempt
to auto-cast the data to the correct type when possible, for proper comparisons with numbers.

You can reorder the columns by simply returning them in the order you want. The `LIMIT` keyword
can be used to limit the number of rows returned.

```cypher
LOAD FROM "ex_data/user.csv" (header = true)
RETURN age, name LIMIT 2;
```
```
┌───────┬─────────┐
│ age   │ name    │
│ INT64 │ STRING  │
├───────┼─────────┤
│ 30    │ Adam    │
│ 40    │ Karissa │
│ 50    │ Zhang   │
│ 25    │ Noura   │
└───────┴─────────┘
```

`LOAD FROM` is a general-purpose clause in Cypher for scanning data from various data sources,
including files and in-memory DataFrames. See the detailed documentation page below for more details
on how to use the `LOAD FROM` clause.
