Cypher supports the `LOAD FROM` clause to scan data from various sources. Scanning is the act of
reading data from a source, but _not inserting it_ into the database. Inserting data into the database
involves "copying"; see the [Import data](/import) section for details.

Scanning data using `LOAD FROM` is useful to inspect a subset of your data, understand its structure,
and perform transformations like rearranging columns.

## General usage

Say you have a `user.csv` file that looks like this:

```csv
// user.csv
name,age
Adam,30
Karissa,40
Zhang,50
Noura,25
```

You can scan the file and count the number of rows:
```cypher
LOAD FROM "user.csv" (header = true)
RETURN COUNT(*);
```
This counts the number of rows in the file.
```
┌──────────────┐
│ COUNT_STAR() │
│ INT64        │
├──────────────┤
│ 4            │
└──────────────┘
```

You can also apply filter predicates via the `WHERE` clause, like this:
```cypher
LOAD FROM "user.csv" (header = true)
WHERE age > 25
RETURN COUNT(*);
```
The above query counts only the rows where the `age` column is greater than 25.
```
┌──────────────┐
│ COUNT_STAR() │
│ INT64        │
├──────────────┤
│ 3            │
└──────────────┘
```
Note that when scanning from CSV files, Kuzu will attempt to auto-cast the data to the correct type
when possible. For example, the `age` column is cast to an `INT64` type.

You can reorder the columns by simply returning them in the order you want. The `LIMIT` keyword
can be used to limit the number of rows returned. The example below returns the first two rows,
with the `age` and `name` columns in the order specified.

```cypher
LOAD FROM "user.csv" (header = true)
RETURN age, name
LIMIT 2;
```
```
┌───────┬─────────┐
│ age   │ name    │
│ INT64 │ STRING  │
├───────┼─────────┤
│ 30    │ Adam    │
│ 40    │ Karissa │
└───────┴─────────┘
```

## More features

`LOAD FROM` is a general-purpose clause in Cypher for scanning data from various data sources,
including files and in-memory DataFrames. See the detailed documentation below for more details
on how to use the `LOAD FROM` clause.
