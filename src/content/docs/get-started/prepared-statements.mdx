title: "Run prepared Cypher statements"
---

Just like we have [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in relational databases,
we can also have Cypher injection in graph databases. This is when a user can manipulate the query
to execute arbitrary code that can threaten the integrity of the data. As a best practice, it's
generally to provide parameters to your Cypher queries instead of using string literals in your code.

This section shows to run *prepared* Cypher statements with parameters while working with a client
API in Kùzu.

## Why use parameters?

Consider a scenario where you want to retrieve all persons in a database who are older than a certain age.
Instead of hardcoding the age value into a Cypher query, it would make more sense to pass it as a parameter
to the query, so that the same query can be reused for other values.

Another situation where parameters are useful is when you want to loop through a list of records and
write each record to the database. Because records may have differnt values for a given property, it's
a good idea to use parameters to provide the values dynamically.

## Syntax

Parameterized variables in Cypher are marked using the `$` symbol. The below query asks for only
persons who are between a minimum and maximum age in the database. In the Python API, the example shows
how to specify the parameters as a dictionary in the `parameters` argument of the `execute` method
of the connection object.

#### ✅ Recommended

The `$min_age` and `$max_age` variables in the Cypher query are mapped to the `min_age` and `max_age`
keys in the `parameters` dictionary, which then retrieve the values from the declared Python variables.

```py
min_age = 18
max_age = 30

conn.execute(
    """
    MATCH (p:Person)
    WHERE p.age > $min_age and p.age < $max_age
    RETURN p.name
    """,
    parameters={"min_age": min_age, "max_age": max_age}
)
```

If you're working with other client APIs, similar principles apply.

#### ❌ Not recommended

Although it's possible to pass the `min_age` and `max_age` variables directly into the query as
string literals, this is **strongly** discouraged in practice.

```py
min_age = 18
max_age = 30

conn.execute(
    f"""
    MATCH (p:Person)
    WHERE p.age > {min_age} and p.age < {max_age}
    RETURN p.name
    """
)
```
