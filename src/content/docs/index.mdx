Welcome to the Kuzu docs!

Kuzu is an embedded graph database built for query speed and scalability. It is optimized for
handling complex join-heavy analytical workloads on very large graphs, with the following core
feature set:

- Property Graph data model and Cypher query language
- Embedded (in-process) integration with applications
- Columnar disk-based storage
- Columnar, compressed sparse row-based (CSR) adjacency list/join indices
- Vectorized and factorized query processor
- Novel and very fast join algorithms
- Multi-core query parallelism
- Serializable ACID transactions

If you're new to Kuzu and graph databases, we recommend starting with this
introductory video. Once you're ready to dive in, check out the rest of the documentation!

## Why Kuzu?

Although there are many graph database management systems (GDBMSs) in the market today,
Kuzu stands apart because it addresses specific trade-offs via its design and implementation that
make it a compelling choice for analytical query workloads on large graphs.
Below, we list some of the key reasons why you may want to consider using Kuzu.

### Performance and scalability

Kuzu is a state-of-the-art graph DBMS that came out of modern academic research, and is built by a
core team of database experts who possess a relentless drive towards scalability and performance.
Its founding engineers have co-authored several cutting-edge technical papers and articles on managing
and querying large graphs.

### Usability

Kuzu is built for industry, and implements a suite of features that lower the barrier of entry
to modeling your records as a graph, so you can query those records in an expressive graph query
language (Cypher). Because Kuzu is an embedded database, it runs in-process with your application,
allowing for simplicity in setup with no external dependencies and no hassles in managing DBMS servers.

### Interoperability

Kuzu is designed to be highly interoperable with a variety of external formats and columnar or relational stores,
including Parquet, Arrow, DuckDB and more. This allows you to easily move your existing data to and from Kuzu,
making it a great choice for graph data science, machine learning and analytics use cases.

### Structured property graph model

The data model in Kuzu is based on the property graph model, with the addition of structure (including
node/edge tables and a pre-defined schema). This makes it flexible and intuitive to model your existing
data as a graph, while also being strict enough to optimize query performance and perform vectorized
operations at scale.

### Open source

Kuzu is open source and has a permissive MIT license, allowing you to easily get started building
your commercial and proprietary applications on top of it. While you check out
[the repo](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu) and try out Kuzu, consider giving us a star and spreading the word!
