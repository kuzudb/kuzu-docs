You can read, write, or glob files hosted on object storage servers using the
[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) API.

## Usage

Accessing GCS storage is implemented as a feature of the `httpfs` extension.

Please see [Install an extension](/extensions#install-an-extension) and [Load an extension](/extensions#load-an-extension) first before getting started.

### Configure the connection

Before reading and writing from private GCS buckets, you have to configure the connection using [CALL](/cypher/configuration) statements.
```cypher
CALL <option_name>=<option_value>
```

The following options are supported:

| Option | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `gcs_access_key_id` | GCS access key ID |
| `gcs_secret_access_key` | GCS secret access key |

Alternatively, you can set the following environment variables:

| Environment variable | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `GCS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | GCS access key ID |
| `GCS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | GCS secret access key |

Since Kuzu communicates with GCS using its [interoperability mode](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/aws-simple-migration),
the following S3 settings also apply when uploading files to GCS. For more detailed descriptions of these settings,
see the documentation for the [S3 extension](/extensions/s3).

| Option name |
|----------|
| `s3_uploader_max_num_parts_per_file` |
| `s3_uploader_max_filesize` |
| `s3_uploader_threads_limit` |

### Scan data from GCS

Files in GCS can be accessed through URLs with the formats

- `gs://⟨gcs_bucket⟩/⟨path_to_file_in_bucket⟩`
- `gcs://⟨gcs_bucket⟩/⟨path_to_file_in_bucket⟩`

For example, if you wish to scan the file `follows.parquet` located in the root directory of bucket `kuzu-datasets` you could use the following query:

```cypher
LOAD FROM 'gs://kuzu-datasets/follows.parquet'
RETURN *;
```

### Glob data from GCS

You can glob data from GCS just as you would from a local file system.

For example, the following query will copy the contents of all files matching the pattern `vPerson*.csv` into the table `person`:

```cypher
COPY person FROM "gs://tinysnb/vPerson*.csv"(header=true);
```

### Write data to GCS

You can also write to files in GCS using URLs in the formats
- `gs://⟨gcs_bucket⟩/⟨path_to_file_in_bucket⟩`
- `gcs://⟨gcs_bucket⟩/⟨path_to_file_in_bucket⟩`

For example, the following query will write to the file located at path `saved/location.parquet` in the bucket `kuzu-datasets`:

```cypher
COPY (
    MATCH (p:Location)
    RETURN p.*
)
TO 'gcs://kuzu-datasets/saved/location.parquet';
```

## Local cache

Scanning the same file multiple times can be slow and redundant.
To avoid this, you can locally cache remote files to improve performance for repeated scans.
See the [local cache](/extensions/httpfs#local-cache) section for more details.
