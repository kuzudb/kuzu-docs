title: K-Core Decomposition
---

The k-core decomposition identifies subgraphs where every node has a degree of at least `k` within the subgraph. 
In other words, a k-core is a maximal subgraph where each node is connected to at least `k` other nodes in the same subgraph. 
The k-core decomposition algorithm iteratively removes nodes with degree less than `k` until no more nodes can be removed,
with the remaining nodes forming the k-core. 

K-Core decomposition is useful in domains like social network analysis, where it can help identify
cohesive groups, and in network resilience analysis, where it can help understand the robustness of a network to node removal.

Kuzu implements a parallelized version of K-Core decomposition based on [Ligra](https://jshun.github.io/ligra/docs/examples.html).

## Syntax

```cypher
CALL k_core_decomposition(
    <GRAPH_NAME>
)
RETURN node, k_degree
```

**Alias**: `kcore`

Required arguments:

- `GRAPH_NAME`: Name of the projected graph to run the algorithm on
    - Type: `STRING`

Returns:

- `node`: A node object
- `k_degree`: The k-core degree of the node

## Example

Create the node and relationship tables:
```cypher
CREATE NODE TABLE Person(name STRING PRIMARY KEY);
CREATE REL TABLE KNOWS(FROM Person to Person);
```
Insert nodes and edges:
```cypher
CREATE (u0:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
        (u1:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
        (u2:Person {name: 'Charlie'}),
        (u3:Person {name: 'Derek'}),
        (u4:Person {name: 'Eve'}),
        (u5:Person {name: 'Frank'}),
        (u6:Person {name: 'George'}),
        (u0)-[:KNOWS]->(u1),
        (u1)-[:KNOWS]->(u2),
        (u2)-[:KNOWS]->(u3),
        (u3)-[:KNOWS]->(u4),
        (u3)-[:KNOWS]->(u5),
        (u3)-[:KNOWS]->(u6),
        (u4)-[:KNOWS]->(u5),
        (u4)-[:KNOWS]->(u6),
        (u5)-[:KNOWS]->(u6);
```
Create a projected graph:
```cypher
CALL project_graph('Graph', ['Person'], ['KNOWS']);
```
Run the K-Core decomposition algorithm on the projected graph:
```cypher
CALL k_core_decomposition('Graph')
RETURN node.name, k_degree
ORDER BY k_degree DESC;
```
```
┌───────────┬──────────┐
│ node.name │ k_degree │
│ STRING    │ INT64    │
├───────────┼──────────┤

│ George    │ 3        │
│ Eve       │ 3        │

│ Charlie   │ 1        │
│ Bob       │ 1        │
│ Alice     │ 1        │
└───────────┴──────────┘
