title: Attaching to external databases

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Kùzu supports attaching/detaching to the following types of external databases:

- [External Kùzu databases](/extensions/attach/kuzu): You can attach to an external Kùzu database
(possibly on a remote file system) and query that database in **read-only** mode via Cypher.
- [External RDBMSs](/extensions/attach/rdbms) | You can attach to several relational databases, such as Postgres,
DuckDB, and SQLite, and scan their tables with the `LOAD FROM` statement. This can simplify copying
data from these sources into Kùzu and can also provide a basic functionality to do joint querying of 
the RDBMS and your local Kùzu database (or an external Kùzu database you attached to).
