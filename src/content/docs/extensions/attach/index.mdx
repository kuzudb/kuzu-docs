title: Attaching to external data sources

Kuzu supports attaching/detaching to the following types of external data sources and databases:

- [External Kuzu databases](/extensions/attach/kuzu): Attach to an external Kuzu database
(possibly on a remote file system) and query that database in **read-only** mode via Cypher.
- [External RDBMSs](/extensions/attach/rdbms) | Attach to several relational databases, such as Postgres,
DuckDB, and SQLite, and scan their tables with the `LOAD FROM` statement. This can simplify copying
data from these sources into Kuzu and can also provide a basic functionality to do joint querying of 
the RDBMS and your local Kuzu database (or an external Kuzu database you attached to).
- [Iceberg](/extensions/attach/iceberg): Attach to Iceberg tables
- [Delta Lake](/extensions/attach/delta): Attach to Delta Lake tables
- [Unity Catalog](/extensions/attach/unity): Attach to Delta Lake tables in Unity Catalog,
an open and unified data goverance solution [by Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog).
