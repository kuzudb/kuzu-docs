title: Attaching to external databases

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Kùzu supports attaching/detaching to two types of external databases:
    - [External Kùzu databases](/extensions/attach/kuzu): You can attach to an external Kùzu database (possibly in a remote file system) and query
      that database in read-only mode in Cypher.
    - [External RDBMSs](/extensions/attach/rdbms): You can attach to several RDBMSs, such as Postgres, DuckDB, and Sqlite,
     and scan their tables with the `LOAD FROM` statement. This can simplify copying data from these sources into Kùzu and
     can also provide a basic functionality to do joint querying of the RDBMS and your local Kùzu database (or an external Kùzu databse you attached to).
