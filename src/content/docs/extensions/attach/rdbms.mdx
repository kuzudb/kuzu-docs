title: Attaching to external RDBMSs

Kuzu supports directly scanning from a variety of relational databases using the `LOAD FROM` statement.
Because RDBMSs are a common source of structured data in enterprises, the purpose behind this set of Kuzu
extensions is currently twofold: (1) to allow users to scan data from external RDBMSs without having to copy it
to a graph database; and (2) if data will be copied over from an RDBMS, this feature also simplifies the pipeline
for copying data from an external RDBMS into Kuzu tables.

The currently available relational database extensions, as well as their minimum required versions,
are shown below:

Extension Name | Description | Minimum Version
:---:|:---:|:---:
`duckdb` | Scan from an attached DuckDB database | 0.10.0
`postgres` | Scan from an attached PostgreSQL database | 14.0
`sqlite` | Scan from an attached SQLite database | 3.3.0
