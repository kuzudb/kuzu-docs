Kuzu supports directly scanning from a variety of relational databases using the `LOAD FROM` statement.
Because RDBMSs are a common source of structured data, Kuzu provides a set of 
extensions to allow users to both scan data from external RDBMSs without having to copy it
into Kuzu and also to simplify copying data from an external RDBMS into Kuzu.

The currently available relational database extensions are shown below:

Extension Name | Description | Minimum Version
:---:|:---:|:---:
[`duckdb`](/extensions/attach/duckdb) | Scan from an attached DuckDB database | 0.10.0
[`postgres`](/extensions/attach/postgres) | Scan from an attached PostgreSQL database | 14.0
[`sqlite`](/extensions/attach/sqlite) | Scan from an attached SQLite database | 3.3.0
