title: Extensions
---

Kuzu has an extension API that is designed to dynamically extend its capabilities. Extensions allow
users to dynamically load the functionality they need at runtime, while helping limit the size of
the core Kuzu library.

# Official Extensions

The available extensions for each OS are listed [here](https://extension.kuzudb.com/).

:::caution[Note]
Third-party developers are welcome to develop their own extensions.
However, note that the extension API is still in development and may change in the future.

We plan to stabilize the extension API and document how users can implement their own extensions.
For now, please reach out to us on Discord or GitHub if you need a custom extension for your use case.

## Using extensions in Kuzu

This section describes how to use officially supported extensions in Kuzu.

### List official extensions

You can list all available official extensions by running:

```sql
CALL SHOW_OFFICIAL_EXTENSIONS() RETURN *;
```

### Install an official extension

Kuzu requires the user to install the extension before loading and using it.

Official extensions can be installed by running the `INSTALL` command:

```sql
INSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```
You only need to install an extension once. 

### Update an official extension

To update an official extension you can use the `UPDATE` command:

```sql
UPDATE <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```

If you run the `INSTALL` command for an extension that is already installed, the second install command will not perform any action.

If you want to forcefully download an extension for any reason, for example if the extension is not working properly, you can use the `FORCE INSTALL` command:

```sql
FORCE INSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```

### Load an extension

Extensions must be loaded before they can be used:

```sql
LOAD <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```

### List loaded extensions

You can view all your loaded extensions by running:

```sql
CALL SHOW_LOADED_EXTENSIONS() RETURN *;
```

Official extensions can be loaded by simply specifying the extension name after installation.  

For example, to load the official `json` extension:

```sql
load json;
```
If you want to load an extension you have compiled yourself, you can specify the path to the compiled library. For example, to load a self-compiled `json` extension:

```sql
LOAD EXTENSION 'extension/httpfs/build/libhttpfs.kuzu_extension';
```

:::note[Note]
Extensions are scoped to the session within which they are loaded. Thus, the `LOAD` command must be
run every time a new CLI session is started or a client script is run.
:::


### Uninstall an official extension.

You can uninstall extensions if you don't need them anymore by using the `UNINSTALL` command:

```sql
UNINSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```
:::note[Note]
Uninstalling a currently loaded extension won't affect the running database instance, but you won't be able to load it again in a new Kuzu instance until it's reinstalled.
