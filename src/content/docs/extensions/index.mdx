description: Dynamically extend Kuzu's capabilities with official extensions for JSON, vector search, full-text search, and more.
---

Kuzu has an extension API that is designed to dynamically extend its capabilities. Extensions allow
you to dynamically load the functionality you need at runtime, while helping limit the size of
the core Kuzu library.

:::caution[Note]
Kuzu no longer provides an official extensions server, from where you can directly install the official extensions.

If you've upgraded to the latest version v0.11.3, Kuzu has pre-installed and pre-loaded four commonly used extensions (`algo`, `fts`, `json`, `vector`) for you.
You do not need to manually INSTALL or LOAD these extensions.

For Kuzu versions before v0.11.3, or to install extensions that haven't been pre-installed into v0.11.3, you have to set up a local extension server.
The instructions of setting up a local extension server can be found [here](/extensions#host-your-own-extension-server).

## Available extensions

The following extensions are currently implemented:

| Extension | Description |
|----------|----------|
| [algo](/extensions/algo) | Graph algorithms |
| [azure](/extensions/azure) | Scan from Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) |
| [delta](/extensions/attach/delta) | Scan data from Delta Lake tables |
| [duckdb](/extensions/attach/duckdb) | Scan data from an attached DuckDB database |
| [fts](/extensions/full-text-search) | Perform full-text search using BM25 |
| [httpfs](/extensions/httpfs) | Read and write files over HTTP(S) protocol. Also used for [attaching a remote Kuzu database](/extensions/attach/kuzu). |
| [iceberg](/extensions/attach/iceberg) | Scan data from Iceberg tables |
| [json](/extensions/json) | Scan and manipulate JSON data |
| [llm](/extensions/llm) | Generate text embeddings using external provider APIs |
| [neo4j](/extensions/neo4j) | Migrate data from Neo4j into Kuzu |
| [postgres](/extensions/attach/postgres) | Scan data from an attached PostgreSQL database |
| [sqlite](/extensions/attach/sqlite) | Scan data from an attached SQLite database |
| [unity](/extensions/attach/unity) | Scan data from Unity Catalog tables |
| [vector](/extensions/vector) | Perform vector similarity search |

## Using extensions in Kuzu

This section describes how to use officially supported extensions in Kuzu.

### List available extensions

You can list all available official extensions by running:

```cypher
CALL SHOW_OFFICIAL_EXTENSIONS() RETURN *;
```

### Install an extension

Kuzu requires you to install the extension before loading and using it.

:::caution[Note]
In the latest version v0.11.3 Kuzu has pre-installed four commonly used extensions (`algo`, `fts`, `json`, `vector`) for you.
You do not need to manually INSTALL these extensions.
:::

Official extensions can be installed from a [local extension server](/extensions#host-your-own-extension-server) by running the `INSTALL` command.

```cypher
INSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME> FROM 'http://localhost:8080/';
```
You only need to install an extension once.

### Update an extension

If you run the `INSTALL` command for an extension that is already installed,
the second install command will not perform any action.

If you want to re-download an extension for any reason, for example if the extension is not working
properly, you can use the `UPDATE` command:

```cypher
UPDATE <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```

### Load an extension

:::caution[Note]
In the latest version v0.11.3, Kuzu has pre-loaded four commonly used extensions (`algo`, `fts`, `json`, `vector`) for you.
You do not need to manually LOAD these extensions anymore.
:::

You must load extensions before you can use them:

```cypher
LOAD <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```

Official extensions can be loaded by simply specifying the extension name.
For example, to load the `json` extension:

```cypher
load json;
```
If you want to load an extension you have compiled yourself, you can specify the path to the compiled library.
For example, to load a self-compiled `json` extension:

```cypher
LOAD EXTENSION 'extension/custom_json/build/libjson.kuzu_extension';
```

### List loaded extensions

You can view all your loaded extensions by running:

```cypher
CALL SHOW_LOADED_EXTENSIONS() RETURN *;
```

:::note[Note]
Extensions are scoped to the session within which they are loaded. Thus, the `LOAD` command must be
executed for every new CLI session or client script invocation.
:::


### Uninstall an extension

You can uninstall extensions if you don't need them anymore by using the `UNINSTALL` command:

```cypher
UNINSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```
:::note[Note]
Uninstalling a currently loaded extension won't affect the running database instance, but you won't be able to load it again in a new Kuzu instance until it's reinstalled.
:::

### Host your own extension server

You can host your own extension server for Kuzu using Docker.

The extension server is based on NGINX and is hosted on [GitHub](https://ghcr.io/kuzudb/extension-repo). You can pull the Docker image and run it in your environment:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/kuzudb/extension-repo:latest
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/kuzudb/extension-repo:latest
```

In this example, the extension server will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. You can then install extensions from your server by appending the `FROM` clause to the `INSTALL` command:

```cypher
INSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME> FROM 'http://localhost:8080/';
```
