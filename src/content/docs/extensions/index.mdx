description: Dynamically extend Kuzu's capabilities with official extensions for JSON, vector search, full-text search, and more.
---

Kuzu has an extension API that is designed to dynamically extend its capabilities. Extensions allow
you to dynamically load the functionality you need at runtime, while helping limit the size of
the core Kuzu library.

# Official Extensions

The available extensions for each OS are listed [here](https://extension.kuzudb.com/).

:::caution[Note]
Third-party developers are welcome to develop their own extensions.
However, note that the extension API is still in development and may change in the future.

We plan to stabilize the extension API and document how you can implement your own extensions.
For now, please reach out to us on Discord or GitHub if you need a custom extension for your use case.

## Using extensions in Kuzu

This section describes how to use officially supported extensions in Kuzu.

### List available extensions

You can list all available official extensions by running:

```cypher
CALL SHOW_OFFICIAL_EXTENSIONS() RETURN *;
```

### Install an extension

Kuzu requires you to install the extension before loading and using it.

Official extensions can be installed by running the `INSTALL` command:

```cypher
INSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```
You only need to install an extension once. 

### Update an extension

If you run the `INSTALL` command for an extension that is already installed,
the second install command will not perform any action.

If you want to re-download an extension for any reason, for example if the extension is not working
properly, you can use the `UPDATE` command:

```cypher
UPDATE <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```

### Load an extension

You must load extensions before you can use them:

```cypher
LOAD <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```

Official extensions can be loaded by simply specifying the extension name.
For example, to load the `json` extension:

```cypher
load json;
```
If you want to load an extension you have compiled yourself, you can specify the path to the compiled library.
For example, to load a self-compiled `json` extension:

```cypher
LOAD EXTENSION 'extension/custom_json/build/libjson.kuzu_extension';
```

### List loaded extensions

You can view all your loaded extensions by running:

```cypher
CALL SHOW_LOADED_EXTENSIONS() RETURN *;
```

:::note[Note]
Extensions are scoped to the session within which they are loaded. Thus, the `LOAD` command must be
executed for every new CLI session or client script invocation.
:::


### Uninstall an extension

You can uninstall extensions if you don't need them anymore by using the `UNINSTALL` command:

```cypher
UNINSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```
:::note[Note]
Uninstalling a currently loaded extension won't affect the running database instance, but you won't be able to load it again in a new Kuzu instance until it's reinstalled.
