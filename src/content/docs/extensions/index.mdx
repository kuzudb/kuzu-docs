Kuzu has an extension API that is designed to dynamically extend its capabilities. Extensions allow
users to dynamically load the functionality they need at runtime, while helping limit the size of
the core Kuzu library.

# Official Extensions

The available extensions for each OS are listed [here](https://extension.kuzudb.com/).

:::caution[Note]
Third-party developers are welcome to develop their own extensions.
However, note that the extension API is still in development and may change in the future.

We plan to stabilize the extension API and document how users can implement their own extensions.
For now, please reach out to us on Discord or GitHub if you need a custom extension for your use case.

## Using extensions in Kuzu

This section describes how to use officially supported extensions in Kuzu.

### Install an official extension

Kuzu requires the user to install the extension before loading and using it.
Official extensions can be installed by running the `INSTALL` command:

```sql
INSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```
You only need to install an extension once.

### Load an official extension
Extensions must be loaded before they can be used:

```sql
LOAD <EXTENSION_NAME>;
```

:::note[Note]
Extensions are scoped to the session within which they are loaded. Thus, the `LOAD` command must be
run every time a new CLI session is started or a client script is run.
