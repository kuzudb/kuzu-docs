Kùzu has an extension framework designed to extend Kùzu's capabilities. Our goal is to implement
more and more extensions over time, such as to support new data types, functions and
indices.

Extensions expose several internal interfaces of Kùzu, for example, the FileSystem, and can have
multiple implementations. Extensions are implementations of these interfaces that can be
dynamically loaded at runtime.

*Official extensions* are implemented and maintained by Kùzu Inc. These are hosted in our [official
extensions repo](https://github.com/kuzudb/extension). 

:::caution[Note]
Third-party developers are also welcome to develop their own extensions for custom functionality.
However, it's important to note that the extension API is still in development and may change in the future.
When it becomes more stable, we will document in more detail how users can implement their own extensions
For now, please reach out to us on Discord or GitHub if you need a custom extension for your use case.

## Using Extensions in Kùzu

This section describes how to use officially supported extensions in Kùzu.

### Installing an official extension

Kùzu requires the user to install the extension before loading and using it.
Official extensions can be simply installed by running the install command:

```cypher
INSTALL <extension_name>
```

Where `extension_name` is the name of the extension to be installed.

### Loading an official extension
After installation, a load command is required to ask Kùzu to dynamically load the shared library.
Extensions installed using the `INSTALL` command can be loaded directly as follows: 

```cypher
LOAD EXTENSION <extension_name>
```
