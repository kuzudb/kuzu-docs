Kuzu has an extension framework designed to extend its capabilities. Our goal is to implement
more and more extensions over time, such as supporting new data types, functions and
indices, or to better integrate with external systems.

Extensions expose several internal interfaces of Kuzu, for example, the FileSystem, and can have
multiple implementations. Extensions are implementations of these interfaces that can be
dynamically loaded at runtime.


# Official Extensions

The available extensions for each OS are listed [here](https://extension.kuzudb.com/).

:::caution[Note]
Third-party developers are also welcome to develop their own extensions for custom functionality.
However, it's important to note that the extension API is still in development and may change in the future.
When it becomes more stable, we will document in more detail how users can implement their own extensions
For now, please reach out to us on Discord or GitHub if you need a custom extension for your use case.

## Available extensions

The following extensions are implemented, with more to come:

| Extension Name | Description |
|----------|----------|
| [httpfs](/extensions/httpfs) | Read and write files over HTTP(s) protocol. Also used for [attaching to a remote Kuzu database](/extensions/attach/kuzu). |
| [duckdb](/extensions/attach/duckdb) | Scan data from an attached DuckDB database |
| [postgres](/extensions/attach/postgres) | Scan data from an attached PostgreSQL database |
| [sqlite](/extensions/attach/sqlite) | Scan data from an attached SQLite database |
| [json](/extensions/json) | Scan and manipulate JSON data |
| [delta](/extensions/delta) | Scan data from Delta Lake tables |
| [iceberg](/extensions/iceberg) | Scan data from Iceberg tables |
| [unity](/extensions/unity) | Scan data from Unity Catalog tables |
| [fts](/extensions/full-text-search) | Perform full-text search using BM25 |
| [vector](/extensions/vector) | Perform vector similarity search |

## Using Extensions in Kuzu

This section describes how to use officially supported extensions in Kuzu.

### Installing an official extension

Kuzu requires the user to install the extension before loading and using it.
Official extensions can be simply installed by running the install command:

```sql
INSTALL <extension_name>
```

Where `extension_name` is the name of the extension to be installed.

### Loading an official extension
After installation, a load command is required to ask Kuzu to dynamically load the shared library.
Extensions installed using the `INSTALL` command can be loaded directly as follows: 

```sql
LOAD <extension_name>
```

:::note[Note]
A new Database object at the C++ level is instantiated every time a new CLI session is started, or
when a client script that embeds Kuzu is run. For this reason, the `LOAD` command must be
run every time a new CLI session is started or a client script is run.
