title: "LLM Extension"
---

The **LLM extension** provides an interface to fetch text embeddings from supported providers and their models.

It can be installed and loaded using the following commands:

```sql
INSTALL llm;
LOAD llm;
```

The list of supported providers and tested models is as follows.

| Provider | Models |
| --- | --- |
| `amazon-bedrock` | amazon.titan-embed-text-v1 |
| `google-vertex` | gemini-embedding-001, text-embedding-005, text-multilingual-embedding-002 |
| `google-gemini` | gemini-embedding-exp-03-07, text-embedding-004, embedding-001 |
| `ollama` | nomic-embed-text, all-minilm:l6-v2 |
| `open-ai` | text-embedding-3-large, text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-ada-002 |
| `voyage-ai` | voyage-3-large, voyage-3.5, voyage-3.5-lite, voyage-code-3, voyage-finance-2, voyage-law-2, voyage-code-2 |

Note: Model names are dynamically validated at runtime. If an unsupported model is specified, the provider's API will return an appropriate error.

## Usage

### Configuration

The LLM extension supports configurable options such as credentials, dimensions, and region where applicable.

- All credentials are provided through environment variables.
- Dimensions and region are passed to the `CREATE_EMBEDDING` function call, when supported.

The following environment variables must be set for the corresponding providers:

| Provider | Required Environment Variables |
| --- | --- |
| `amazon-bedrock` | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| `google-vertex` | `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`, `GOOGLE_VERTEX_ACCESS_KEY` |
| `google-gemini` | `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `open-ai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `voyage-ai` | `VOYAGE_API_KEY` |

Note that the `ollama` provider requires no environment variables but does require the embedding model to be available at `http://localhost:11434`.

## Embedding Function

The core feature of the LLM extension is a scalar function that generates text embeddings.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE_EMBEDDING(prompt: STRING, provider: STRING, model: STRING) -> LIST<FLOAT>
```

### Overloads

```sql
CREATE_EMBEDDING(prompt: STRING, provider: STRING, model: STRING, dimensions: INT64) -> LIST<FLOAT>
```

```sql
CREATE_EMBEDDING(prompt: STRING, provider: STRING, model: STRING, region: STRING) -> LIST<FLOAT>
```

```sql
CREATE_EMBEDDING(prompt: STRING, provider: STRING, model: STRING, dimensions: INT64, region: STRING) -> LIST<FLOAT>
```

### Parameters

- **prompt**: The input text to embed.
- **provider**: The embedding provider, e.g., `'open-ai'`, `'ollama'`, `'voyage-ai'`, etc.
- **model**: The identifier of the embedding model. This may change overtime; reference the provider's API reference before use.
- **dimensions** *(optional)*: The size of the embedding vector to be returned, if supported by the provider. Must be a positive integer.
- **region** *(optional)*: A region or endpoint hint, if supported by the provider.

### Examples

```sql
CREATE_EMBEDDING("Hello world", "openai", "text-embedding-3-small")
```

With optional parameters:

```sql
CREATE_EMBEDDING("Hello world", "openai", "text-embedding-3-small", 512)
```

```sql
CREATE_EMBEDDING("Hello world", "amazon-bedrock", "amazon.titan-embed-text-v1", "us-east-1");
```

```sql
CREATE_EMBEDDING("Hello world", "google-vertex", "gemini-embedding-001", 256, "us-east1");
```

## Providers and Configuration

### Region Support

The following providers support region configuration. The list of regions may not be exhaustive. Please reference the provider's API reference for more information about what regions are supported.
There is no default region; a region argument must be passed to the function call to use these providers.

| Provider | Regions |
| --- | --- |
| `amazon-bedrock` | us-east-1, us-west-2, ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1, eu-central-1 |
| `google-vertex` | us-central1, us-west1, us-west2, us-west3, us-west4, us-east1, us-east4, us-south1, northamerica-northeast1, northamerica-northeast2, southamerica-east1, southamerica-west1, europe-west2, europe-west1, europe-west4, europe-west6, europe-west3, europe-north1, europe-central2, europe-west8, europe-west9, europe-southwest1, asia-south1, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, asia-east2, asia-east1, asia-northeast1, asia-northeast2, australia-southeast1, australia-southeast2, asia-northeast3, me-west1 |

Note: Regions are dynamically validated at runtime. If an unsupported region is specified, the provider's API will return an error.

### Dimensions Support

The following providers support dimension configuration. 

| Provider | Models |
| --- | --- |
| `google-vertex` | gemini-embedding-001, text-embedding-005, text-multilingual-embedding-002 |
| `open-ai` | text-embedding-3-large, text-embedding-3-small |
| `voyage-ai` | voyage-3-large, voyage-3.5, voyage-3.5-lite, voyage-code-3 |

Note: The list of models that support dimension configuration may change
overtime. The set of valid dimensions is determined by the provider and may also
change over time. It is highly recommended to check the provider's API reference
before use. If an unsupported dimension is specified, the provider's API will return an error.
