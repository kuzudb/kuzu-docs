title: "Azure extension"
---
The Azure extension adds support for scanning from [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview)
and [Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction).

## Usage

Unlike the [S3](/extensions/s3) and [GCS](/extensions/gcs) extensions, the Azure extension
is not implemented as a feature of the `httpfs` extension, but rather, as its own extension.
Install the `azure` extension as follows:

```sql
INSTALL azure;
LOAD azure;
```

### Configure the connection

Before reading and writing from Azure, you have to configure the connection using CALL statements.

```sql
CALL <OPTION_NAME> = <OPTION_VALUE>;
```
The following options are supported:

| Option | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `azure_connection_string` | Azure connection string |
| `azure_account_name` | Azure storage account name |

Alternatively, you can set the following environment variables:

| Environment variable | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` | Azure connection string |
| `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Azure storage account name |

At least one of the options must be set. Generally, `azure_connection_string` should be used.
`azure_account_name` is only useful for connecting to a container that allows anonymous read access.

### Scan data from Azure

The extension supports both `az` and [`abfss`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction-abfs-uri) URI schemes. We recommend using `abfss` when scanning
from ADLS for much better performance.

For example, to scan from a container:
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
```sql
LOAD FROM 'abfss://container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
You can also use a fully qualified path:
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://account_name.blob.core.windows.net/container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```

Currently, we only support scanning from Azure Blob Storage. If you're looking for other specific features,
open a an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/issues) (please check if there's already
an existing issue related to "Azure" first).
