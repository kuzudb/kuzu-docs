title: "Azure extension"
---
The Azure extension adds support for scanning from Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
To install and load the Azure extension, run the following commands:
```sql
INSTALL azure;
LOAD azure;
```
## Usage
### Configuration
The Azure extension adds a few configurable options, primarily for authentication:
- `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING`
- `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_HTTP_PROXY`
- `AZURE_PROXY_USER_NAME`
- `AZURE_PROXY_PASSWORD`

Upon loading the extension, for all options, if there exists an environment variable with
the same name, then it is initialized with that value. Otherwise it is left as an empty string
by default. You can configure an option yourself like usual:
```sql
CALL azure_connection_string = '...';
```
For more information,
refer to the documentation on [`CALL`](/cypher/query-clauses/call/).

### Scanning
The supported URI schemes are `az` and `abfss`. While they could both work for both Azure blob storage and ADLS,
it is recommended to use `abfss` when scanning from ADLS as it has potential for significantly better performance.
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://container/path/test.csv'
RETURN *;
```
```sql
LOAD FROM 'abfss://container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
One can also use a fully qualified path:
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://account_name.blob.core.windows.net/container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
