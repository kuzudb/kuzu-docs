title: "Azure extension"
---
The Azure extension adds support for scanning from [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview) and [Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction).

## Usage

```sql
INSTALL azure;
LOAD azure;
```

### Configure the connection

Before reading and writing from Azure, you have to configure the connection using CALL statements.

```sql
CALL <OPTION_NAME> = <OPTION_VALUE>;
```
The following options are supported:

- `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING`: The connection string to use for the Azure storage account.
- `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: The name of the Azure storage account.

At least one of the above options must be set. Generally, `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` should be used.
`AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` is only useful for connecting to a container that allows anonymous read access.

You can also set the above options using environment variables.

### Scan from Azure

The extension supports both `az` and [`abfss`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction-abfs-uri) URI schemes. We recommend using `abfss` when scanning
from ADLS for much better performance.

For example, to scan from a container:
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
```sql
LOAD FROM 'abfss://container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
You can also use a fully qualified path:
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://account_name.blob.core.windows.net/container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
