title: "Azure extension"
---
The Azure extension adds support for scanning from Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
To install and load the Azure extension, run the following commands:
```sql
INSTALL azure;
LOAD azure;
```
## Usage
### Configuration
The Azure extension adds two configurable options for authentication.
- `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING`
- `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`

At least one of the above options must be set. For most use cases, `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` should be used.
`AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` is only useful for scanning from a public / anonymous container.

Upon loading the extension, both options are initialized from the environment variable of the same name, if it exists.
Otherwise it is left as an empty string by default. You can configure an option yourself like usual:
```sql
CALL AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING = '...';
```

### Scanning
The supported URI schemes are `az` and `abfss`. While they could both work for both Azure blob storage and ADLS,
it is recommended to use `abfss` when scanning from ADLS as it can potentially lead to significantly better performance.
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://container/path/test.csv'
RETURN *;
```
```sql
LOAD FROM 'abfss://container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
One can also use a fully qualified path:
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://account_name.blob.core.windows.net/container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
