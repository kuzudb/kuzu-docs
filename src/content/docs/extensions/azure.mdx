title: "Azure extension"

The Azure extension adds support for scanning from Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).

## Usage

```sql
INSTALL azure;
LOAD azure;
```

### Configure the connection

Before reading and writing from Azure, you have to configure the connection using CALL statements.

```sql
CALL <OPTION_NAME> = <OPTION_VALUE>;
```
The following options are supported:

- `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING`: The connection string to use for the Azure storage account.
- `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: The name of the Azure storage account.

At least one of the above options must be set. Generally, `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` should be used.
`AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` is only useful for connecting to a public or anonymous container.

You can also set the above options using environment variables.

### Scan from Azure

The extension supports both `az` and `abfss` URI schemes. We recommend using `abfss` when scanning
from ADLS for much better performance.

For example, to scan from a public container:
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
```sql
LOAD FROM 'abfss://container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
You can also use a fully qualified path:
```sql
LOAD FROM 'az://account_name.blob.core.windows.net/container/path/to/file.csv'
RETURN *;
```
