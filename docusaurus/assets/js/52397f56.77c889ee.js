A good way to understand the property graph model is as tagging your tables as "node" and "relationship tables" depending on their roles in your application data. Nodes are generally suitable to represent entities in your applications, while relationships represent the relationships/connections. Relationships are the primary means to join nodes with each other to find paths and patterns in your graph database. So when you define a node label and a set of nodes/relationships, this is equivalent to defining a table or records as nodes or relationships. During querying you can bind node records in syntax like (a:Person), while relationships in syntax like (..)-',"[e:Knows]","->(...). Similar to table definitions in SQL, node and relationship tables have primary keys, a term that is defined in the context of tables: node tables explicitly define primary keys as one of their properties, while the primary keys of relationship tables are implicitly defined by the primary keys of their FROM and TO node records.
