# Overview
K첫zu provides a flexible and robust extension framework designed to allow users to extend database
functionalities (e.g. data types, functions and file system) by dynamically loading extensions.

# Official extensions

The available extensions for each OS are hosted in the `kuzudb/extension` [repo](https://github.com/kuzudb/extension).

| Extension Name | Description |
|----------|----------|
| httpfs | Adds support for reading and writing files over HTTP(s) protocol |

# Using extensions in K첫zu

## Install extension
K첫zu requires the user to install the extension before loading and using it. We support selected
extensions, but users can also load their own extensions (or those developed by third-parties).

### 1. Install an official extension
Official extensions can be simply installed by running the install command:

```
INSTALL extension_name
```

Where `extension_name` is the name of the extension to be installed.

### 2. Install an unofficial extension
If the extension is developed by a third-party developer, you have to download and install
the extension library yourself.

## Load extension
After installation, a load command is required to ask K첫zu to dynamically load the shared library.

### 1. Load an official extension
Extensions installed using the `INSTALL` command can be loaded directly as follows: 

```
LOAD EXTENSION httpfs
```

### 2. Load an unofficial extension
For unofficial extensions, you have to specify the path to the extension library in the load command:

```
LOAD EXTENSION 'PATH_TO_SHARED_LIBRARY'
```
