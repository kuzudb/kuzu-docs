Kùzu is an embedded graph database, meaning that it runs in-process with your application, without
the need to set up a server. This makes it really easy to use and deploy. Although Kùzu's core
is written in C++, it can be accessed through a variety of language bindings. Depending on which
languages you want to build your applications or workflows in, you can choose to explore the relevant
