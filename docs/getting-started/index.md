# Getting Started

Welcome to Kùzu!

Let's get started!
The following sections are intended to provide a straightforward introduction to Kùzu, including hands-on experience with [installation](./../installation.md), usage via our Command Line Interface (CLI), and our supported APIs.
Additionally, it covers essential parts of our Cypher query language.
For complete cypher statements we supported, please visit our [Cypher documentation section](../cypher).
To simplify your journey, we've prepared several [Google Colab notebook examples](./python#colab-notebooks), allowing you to explore Kùzu without the troubles of local installation.

Upon completion of this tutorial, you may wish to move on to our [Data Import](../data-import/) section to understand options available to start a database with data importation, or [Cypher](../cypher) to gain a more formal knowledge of the query language.
For those who are interested in our CLI and supported APIs, the [Client APIs](../client-apis) section provide detailed information.

Welcome aboard, and enjoy your exploration of Kùzu!
