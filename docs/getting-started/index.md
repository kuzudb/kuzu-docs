# Getting Started

Welcome to Kùzu!

Let's get started!
The following sections are intended to give a simple [introduction](./introduction-examples.md) to Kùzu with some hands-on experience, including how to install and use Kùzu through our CLI, Python, and C++ APIs.
We also cover essential parts of our Cypher query language.
For complete cypher statements we supported, please visit our [Cypher documentation section](../cypher).
For you to get started easily without any troubles of installing Kùzu locally, we also prepared some [Colab notebook examples](./colab-notebooks.md).

After you have worked through this tutorial, you might want to move on to reading [Data Import](../data-import/) to understand options available to start a database with data importation, or [Cypher](../cypher) to gain a more formal knowledge of the query language.
Those who are interested in our CLI, Python, and C++ APIs can find more details in [Client APIs](../client-apis).
