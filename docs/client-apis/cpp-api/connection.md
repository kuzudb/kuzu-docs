# Connection

To issue a query, you need to create a `Connection` using a pointer to 
a [Database](database.md) instance. You can use connections to execute statements.
You can construct multiple connections that connect to the same `Database` instance and issue parallel queries through these connections concurrently.

You can also use a `Connection` to prepare `PreparedStatement`, which
is a way to parameterize queries for repeated execution and avoid planning the same query.


## Example
```
auto connection = Connection(&database);
connection.query("CREATE NODE TABLE person (ID INT64, ColA INT64, PRIMARY KEY (ID));")
```

## Available APIs
## class kuzu::main::Connection

Connection is used to interact with a Database instance. Each Connection is thread-safe. Multiple connections can connect to the same Database instance in a multi-threaded environment.  

---

```c++
KUZU_API Connection (Database * database)
```
Creates a connection to the database. 

**Parameters**
- `database` A pointer to the database instance that this connection will be connected to. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API void beginReadOnlyTransaction ()
```
Manually starts a new read-only transaction in the current connection. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API void beginWriteTransaction ()
```
Manually starts a new write transaction in the current connection. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API void commit ()
```
Manually commits the current transaction. 

---

```c++
template<typename... Args> KUZU_API std::unique_ptr<QueryResult> execute (PreparedStatement * preparedStatement, std::pair< std::string, Args >... args)
```
Executes the given prepared statement with args and returns the result. 

**Parameters**
- `preparedStatement` The prepared statement to execute. 
- `args` The parameter pack where each arg is a std::pair with the first element being parameter name and second element being parameter value. 

**Returns:**
- the result of the query. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API std::unique_ptr<QueryResult> executeWithParams (PreparedStatement * preparedStatement, std::unordered_map< std::string, std::shared_ptr< common::Value >> & inputParams)
```
Executes the given prepared statement with inputParams and returns the result. 

**Parameters**
- `preparedStatement` The prepared statement to execute. 
- `inputParams` The parameter pack where each arg is a std::pair with the first element being parameter name and second element being parameter value. 

**Returns:**
- the result of the query. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API uint64_t getMaxNumThreadForExec ()
```
Returns the maximum number of threads to use for execution in the current connection. 

**Returns:**
- the maximum number of threads to use for execution in the current connection. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API std::string getNodePropertyNames (const std::string & tableName)
```

**Parameters**
- `nodeTableName` The name of the node table. 

**Returns:**
- all property names of the given table. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API std::string getNodeTableNames ()
```

**Returns:**
- all node table names in string format. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API std::string getRelPropertyNames (const std::string & relTableName)
```

**Parameters**
- `relTableName` The name of the rel table. 

**Returns:**
- all property names of the given table. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API std::string getRelTableNames ()
```

**Returns:**
- all rel table names in string format. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API void interrupt ()
```
Interrupts all queries currently executed within this connection. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API std::unique_ptr<PreparedStatement> prepare (const std::string & query)
```
Prepares the given query and returns the prepared statement. 

**Parameters**
- `query` The query to prepare. 

**Returns:**
- the prepared statement. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API std::unique_ptr<QueryResult> query (const std::string & query)
```
Executes the given query and returns the result. 

**Parameters**
- `query` The query to execute. 

**Returns:**
- the result of the query. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API void rollback ()
```
Manually rollbacks the current transaction. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API void setMaxNumThreadForExec (uint64_t numThreads)
```
Sets the maximum number of threads to use for execution in the current connection. 

**Parameters**
- `numThreads` The number of threads to use for execution in the current connection. 

---

```c++
KUZU_API void setQueryTimeOut (uint64_t timeoutInMS)
```
Sets the query timeout value of the current connection. A value of zero (the default) disables the timeout.
