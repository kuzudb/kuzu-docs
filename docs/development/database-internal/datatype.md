# DataTypes

There are two data type classes in KÃ¹zu, `LogicalType` and `PhysicalType`.

## LogicalType

Logical type refers to how data is conceptually organized during query compilation. Logical type does NOT care how data is actually stored and processed during query execution. Different logical types may have the same physical type during storage/query processing, e.g. both `INT32` and `DATE` logical type will have `INT32` physical type.

During query compilation i.e. parsing, binding and planning, logical type should always be used.


## PhysicalType

Physical type refers to the specific format of data as it is physically stored on disk on in-memory.

Physical type is preferred in storage and query processing. E.g. columns are constructed by on physical type. OrderBy order also only process physical type of value vector. Using physical type is not mandatory, if you need to make a distinction between logical types, then you will need to fall back to logical type.
