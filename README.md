# Kuzu Documentation

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This documentation site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and
[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). The sections below describe the site's structure and
the commands for installation, local development and build instructions.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro + Starlight project, there exist the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed
as a route based on its file name.

> [!NOTE]
> MDX combines JSX and Markdown to make it easier to write component-driven content like tabbed code blocks.
> Starlight requires that you work with `.mdx` files instead of `.md` when using JSX components. See the official
> [documentation](https://mdxjs.com/) for more information on MDX syntax and why it exists.

Images are added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Any additional static assets (like fonts, favicon, PDFs, etc.) that will not be processed by Astro
are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
